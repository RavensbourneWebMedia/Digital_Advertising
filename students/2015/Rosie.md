## Introduction

This is my hand-in package for Web Design principles Theme 2 (Design). For this unit, I completed 2 group projects and 2 individual projects to improve my ability to think creatively, see things for what they could be, and to teach me about principles I hadn't come across before. Below you will find links to my project material and blogs.

## Eyebombing

For this team project, we had to find faces in every day objects. this was to help us really see our surroundings rather than just observing them.

## OneTweet

For this individual project, we had to create a minimum of 5 typography posters for a tweet of our choice. I had originally used the famous Ed Balls tweet, but due to my lack of ability with Illustrator and the small amount of content to play with, I switched to the CIA's first tweet.

## The Union Hack

For this group project, we had to create different variations of a 'mashed-up' flag, and produce our own flag for a real or fictional place of our choice.

## Code In Your Plate

For this individual project, I had to choose a recipe and write out the HTML and CSS code for it. This was the project I was most looking forward to, but was the most difficult, as I'm extremely new to coding. <a href="https://d157rqmxrxj6ey.cloudfront.net/wwwtf/16114/">Here</a> is a link to my recipe, and my blog post is <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/students.rave.ac.uk/file/d/0B4MyhvimzX_fNVQ5RzhRUzdrVWs/view?usp=sharing">here.</a>

## Peer Learning

Each week, we were assigned to team and given a topic to research before presenting our findings to the class the next week This was a way of helping each other to learn something. <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/students.rave.ac.uk/file/d/0B4MyhvimzX_fYUJyYVBBR3gzb3c/view?usp=sharing">Here</a> is a link to all of my presentations, and <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/students.rave.ac.uk/file/d/0B4MyhvimzX_fYUJyYVBBR3gzb3c/view?usp=sharing">here</a> is a link to my blog about peer learning.
