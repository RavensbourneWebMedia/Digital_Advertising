**Name**: Josh van Niekerk

**Student No**: 96293615

**Course**: BA (HONS) Web Media, Level 1.

**Unit Code**: WEB14103

### Introduction

This unit was highly beneficial to me as I learned the principles of visual communication. This was done through research and designing objects that communicate. I have looked at how people make sense of visual perception as well as exploring photography and image manipulation. Typography and graphic layout were also topics covered and I gained greater understanding in these fields through in depth research as well as getting hands on with tasks. I worked in teams as well as individually effectively, and am very pleased with what I have learned, produced and presented.

### **Summative Presentation**

I presented my Summative Presentation via YouTube as I was unable to attend the lecture. I went through the process and my improvements I made throughout the project. I explained the thinking behind my work, sketches and ultimately final products.
