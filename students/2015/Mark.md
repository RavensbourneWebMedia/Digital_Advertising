## EyeBombing

I'll post my 5 chosen, final edited images below (apologies for the weird ratios, didn't want them to be too big on here). You''ll find <b>ALL</b> of my images on Github [here](https://github.com/FacesInThings/EyeBombing/tree/master/Mark_images), and the ones below [here](https://github.com/FacesInThings/EyeBombing/tree/master/Mark_final_images) as well.

## OneTweet

You can find my all my OneTweet posters [here](http://imgur.com/gallery/ZBEvr/new) (Github was being horrible to me, and I was running out of time!).

I'll post 2 of the finished ones below, amended after the formative assessment to fit the brief:

## The Union Hack

All of my work is shown in my blog post. To make it easier for both of us, I incorporated both the project, with the design and concept phase into the post, so everything can be viewed at the same time. To save you scrolling, I'll leave the link [here](http://bewes.co.nf/?p=42) again, in case you need it. If you want to see the images separately, find them [here](http://imgur.com/gallery/X4TFi/new).

I mentioned in my presentation at the start, that the reason I chose to show my work on The Union Hack for today (2nd), is because my work that I made at the start was pretty rubbish to be perfectly honest. Obviously what I showed today isn't perfect, and with some further work, could be even better, but I am much happier showing you the improvements, and I am proud of it now. As proof that it was pretty bad before I present to you the Macedonian flag, with inverted colours:

![Inverted Macedonia](http://i.imgur.com/ApMbhrt.gif)

This is the only one I saved. The thought behind it was with the yellow in the original, it gives the impression of light reflecting out? Whereas the one below almost creates a perspective like the image is moving down towards the circle. Almost like a pit. No real thought process, just thought it could look cool.

## Code in your plate

You can view the recipe on Github pages [here](http://bewes.github.io/CSSTricks/) (Repository [here](https://github.com/bewes/CSSTricks) if you need it), and grab the HTML and CSS files from [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B4ycyfKO30GjWDdIMjFNUW1RSlk&usp=sharing).

I'm 99% sure that's everything (I hope). Just like to add that I've learned <b>a lot</b> during your lectures, and improved my skills over the first term. Big thanks! Enjoy your vacation to Italy. 

Buon Natale e felice anno nuovo!
