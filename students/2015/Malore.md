# Blogs

Here are all the links to my blog posts I created. Each week we were given a different subject or question and then had to give our opinions of the issues in the format of a blog posts. I used Medium to generate my posts. I liked this site because it has a simple layout and all my blogposts can be kept together on one page. I didn't find them too difficult to complete, once I started it became easier to do. I would say that from now on I'm going to start the blog posts as soon as we are given them. Below I have given a link to my Medium profile page and also individual ones to each post.

# Union Hack - [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/a/rave.ac.uk/folderview?id=0B0og3l7c9_15TGEyZlM2TDdhNzA&usp=sharing_eid&ts=567264b2)
 
For this project we had to make numerous variations of flags. I worked with Afsara for this and we divided the different versions of the flag we were planning to make between us. Also we also had to make an extra flag for a made up place. I chose to design a flag for Narnia as I already know quite a lot about this book/film so this would make it easier. I know that there already is a flag for Narnia, so I made sure that I made mine completely different. I have left a link for Google Drive where all my Union Hack work is. 

# EyeBombing - [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/a/rave.ac.uk/folderview?id=0B0og3l7c9_15dEZ2RE9haUJyZUk&usp=sharing_eid&ts=56726482)

For this project we were set a task to _'find faces in places'_. In my group, which was Afsara and Ajay, we went around the uni and surrounding area and looked out for any where we could visualize a face. We did this successfully, proucing a fair amount of photos of areas such as shadows, drain covers and building structures. We  paid close attention to small details as most of our faces were in much smaller spaces. I obviously needed my own eyebombing photos, so I then went on to take my own. These ones were taken at all different whenever I was out. I feel like now I'm seeing faces in everywhere I go in places I least expected them to be. I have left a link to all my photos for this which are on Google Drive. 

# OneTweet - [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/a/rave.ac.uk/folderview?id=0B0og3l7c9_15RHFmS3M4el9Nd2M&usp=sharing_eid&ts=5672649e)

For this project we had to use a the text of a tweet to produce a meaningful piece of typography. There was a list that Matteo provie to us which we could pick a tweet from. Originally I chose the Kim Kardashan tweet: **'EWW Im at lunch,the woman at the table next 2 me is breast feeding her baby w no coverup then puts baby on the table and changes her diaper'**. I found this quite difficult to use as it was too long and even though I know quite a bit about the Kardashians I still found it quite difficult trying to make this in to typography. I have still put the ones I created for this tweet in my Google Drive file. I then changed the tweet I was doing to Edward Snowdens: **'Can you hear me now?'**. I found this tweet a lot easier to work with as it had a lot more meaning behind it. I found a lot of my ideas for this through research.


#Code in your plate - [site](https://d157rqmxrxj6ey.cloudfront.net/maloremilchard/16861/) & [CSS(Thimble)](https://thimble.mozilla.org/user/maloremilchard/66454)

For this project we chose a recipe and then ,using code, make the recipe into a website. I used thimble to create my code. I have uploaded a link on here for the final site and also the thimble css code site.

#Peer-Learning Presentations

For a few weeks we were put into teams and presented a different subject each time. This was really helpful as you learnt new stuff when researching online for your own presentation but also when listening to other groups.

Below is the link to my Formative Presentation that I completed and presented with Afsara. It contains the work we did in teams which was EyeBombing and Union Hack.

The link below is for my Summative Presentation. It contains the same projects as the formative but also my One Tweet work. However, for this work in this one I worked on some of the suggestions I was given.
