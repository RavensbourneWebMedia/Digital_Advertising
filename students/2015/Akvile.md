# Introduction

During the Web Design Principles unit I had to work on 4 different projects that had to be completed over the first term. Two of the projects were group ones and two were individual. The work that we produced during this unit would help us to improve on our creativity, imagination and team working skills. I will be briefly explaining what each project was and what I worked on during them. This document contains all the information and links to all my work during this unit.

## Eye Bombing

During this project our task was to look for faces in everyday objects and surroundings. Our task was to spot out shapes that form faces and then photograph them. The goal of this project was to try and see things that you usually wouldn't, meaning we needed to work on taking the photos with different angles and try to create the faces from those angles. From the photos taken we can also edit them to make the faces in them stand out more and make it more visible or obvious while trying to still keep the original face without adding any extra details.

### My Photos

The link below will take you to the GitHub repository where you can find all of my favorite images. I decided to keep only the best one as this project was hard for me to do, therefore I decided to only upload photos that I believe are good. I also did not want to edit any of the images as I wanted to try and have the faces to be naturally made by the objects which I photographed.

### Group presentation
For the group part Darren, Rosie and I created a presentation in which we put our favourite photos that we took and some of the edited variations of them in Photoshop.

You can find the group presentation here: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TQYQjqEttqpZ6RliPp-auOnRoooQ4ClzWIAsar0Ggug/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TQYQjqEttqpZ6RliPp-auOnRoooQ4ClzWIAsar0Ggug/edit?usp=sharing "Eye Bombing")

##OneTweet

OneTweet was one of the individual projects that we had to do. The goal of this project was to portray a message using only letters and text in illustrator. The idea of it was to show meaning or create an image using text. We had to create posters using a tweet either from the list given or find one that we liked. I chose to do this tweet:

> I typed your symptoms into the thingy here, and it says u could have network connectivity problems.

I wanted to choose a tweet that was funny but at the same time be related to the theme of internet and the web. We were also told we can explore different visual perception techniques such as symmetry, continuation, similarity and others.

Below is the link to my presentation of the OneTweet project which shows the posters I have created for this project.

## The Union Hack
This was the second group project we had to work on. The Union Hack was a project with the idea of exploring brands and symbols by experimenting with flags of the world.

For this project I worked with my team to create some variations of flags and our own flag, while at the same time I also decided to make my own mash-up flags and redesign an already existing flag.

For the group presentation we worked on the flags of The United Kingdom, Wales, Japan and America. For our flag we decided to create one for the fictional nation of Westeros from the TV Show 'Game of Thrones'. In the design we decided to combine the colours of the rainbow to represent each family house from the show, however, seeing as it was a bit too crowded we decided to go and keep the colours but instead of the coat of arms of the houses we decided to add the 'Iron Throne' from the show instead.

For my flags I decided to choose to mash-up Argentina and Barbados. I found that both flags had similar colours and similar ideas behind the symbols they used. I also wanted to explore the use of colours in flags, therefore I chose to experiment with my home town's, Kaunas, flag.

For my own flag I decided to redesign the Japanese flag. I chose it because I've always wanted to visit Japan as I love their culture and scenery while at the same time having the flag being very simple and basic I thought there is a lot of potential of how it can be redesigned.

##Code In Your Plate
In this individual project we were introduced to coding using HTML and CSS while using MarkDown to create a food recipe and then code it to work on an HTML document. 

For my recipe I chose to make one for Beef Tacos. I used MarkDown to write up the recipe and then added the necessary codes to separate the text into headings, paragraphs and lists.

This is the link for my MarkDown file: [https://github.com/aiharachan/WEB14103-Akvile-Petrauskaite/blob/master/Code%20In%20Your%20Plate/Beef%20Taco%20Recipe.md](https://github.com/aiharachan/WEB14103-Akvile-Petrauskaite/blob/master/Code%20In%20Your%20Plate/Beef%20Taco%20Recipe.md)

I also created two versions using CSS of my recipe on Thimble.

##Peer Learning
During this unit we had also worked on peer learning. For this we were all split up into groups and had different topics to cover and teach the rest of the class using a presentation.

###Visual Perception Principles
For this tutorial I worked together with Rosie and Darren. We had to cover the Continuation principle.

Our presentation: [https://prezi.com/evhxseosljkx/continuation/](https://prezi.com/evhxseosljkx/continuation/)

###Typography
On this topic I worked with Will and John. Our theme was to teach expressive typography.

Our presentation: [https://docs.google.com/a/students.rave.ac.uk/presentation/d/1ZFei_hj37aERwxgsfxb4B_40_UXVm70iHk3U-z6cIfw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/a/students.rave.ac.uk/presentation/d/1ZFei_hj37aERwxgsfxb4B_40_UXVm70iHk3U-z6cIfw/edit?usp=sharing)

Video example I found to visually explain how it can be used: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IaeBPYnqxE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IaeBPYnqxE)

###CSS Tricks
For the CSS Tricks presentation I worked with Ajay and Francisco and we covered the area of CSS Animations.
