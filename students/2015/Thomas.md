### Introduction

I was set four different tasks to challegene both our creative and inteleectual abilities both on and off the computer, using DLR camereas, Photoshop, working with vectors on Illustrator and using HTML and CSS. 

Using some of the skills I learnt from this Unit, I created my own website where I host all of my blog pages and projects which I hope to use in the furture as my own personal online portfolio. You can find it at - [HERE](http://thomasmurphy.com.gridhosted.co.uk)

### Code In Your Plate

##### Online Recipe : Garlic Chicken Kievs

For this project, we had to initially write our recipe down using Markdown, then convert it to HTML and add to the recipes design and content using HTML and CSS properties. Below yo will find the links to the inital markdown file, the completed hosted webpage, and thee GitHub repository for the source code and stylesheets.

#### The Union Hack

The second project here we had to design flags. The project is broken down into two parts. A) Redesign or mashup exisisting flags, to make them more modern and 21st Century, and also to meet the design brief set by the TED Talk to 'desiging a good flag'. B? Then create our own flag to replace a current one or for our own imaginary place. Below you will find the links to my Github Repository, Blog Post on my website, and Presentation dicussing my designs.

### One Tweet

For this project, we were given a list of tweets to choose from and then design a bunch of Typography posters on, being as creative as we can to convey meaning and messages usinging nothign but text and colour alone. Below you can find my Github Repository, Blog post on my website discussing my ideas.

#### Eyebombing

Finally, for this project we had to find, or fall upon, inanimate objects that when viewed at certain angles, unintentionally represent a face type resemblance. This allowed me to work on my camera technique and to explore new angle and methods of taking photos. Below you will find my Github Repository, Blog post on my website presenting my ideas.

*Unfortunatley I presented my OneTweet project via GitHub and no longer have a copy of the version on the day of my formative. However if you view my blog post of the project, you can follow the updates to my work made after the formative based on its feedback.

### Summative Presentation

For my summative, I chose to present my favourite project and show how I changed my work and built on it based on the feedback I recevied during the Fortmative. Therefore, I chose to do the OneTweet Project. 

I liked the project as I found it most challenging in Adobe Illustrator, which I had no clue how to use before, and now I feel like i've developed lots of skills from this project that I could comfortably use this software to develop logos and graphics in the future.

Thank you.
