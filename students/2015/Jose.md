# WEB14103: Web Design Principles

**Name:** Jose Bayon Torres

**Student No:** 96291415

**Course:** BA(Hons) Web Media, Level 1

**Unit Code:** WEB14103


## Introduction

The following document compounds of all the works and projects I took part in the first term of the course Web Design Principles run by Matteo Menapace. 

The course taught me a wide range of skills and tools to start thinking of the web as a designer, applying the required knowledge in visual principles needed to develop a responsive and effective Web space in which a consistent message is sent through visual elements. 

We covered aspects from basic photography skill sets, typography or graphic design to some HTML and responsive CSS. All of them were taught in a practical manner which I documented in several blog posts and GitHub backup repositories as a way to share the knowledge and processes with my peers and everyone interested.  

I also made some peer-learning sessions with my colleagues, teaming up to try and explain the concepts we will be needing in the immediate next steps of the projects previously mentioned. This also helped developing my communicational skills, big asset for any web designer working in the industry.

The aims and learning goals of the project can be found in

## Software & Tools discovered

To finish this hand-in package, I would like to share one of the best things I can take out from this course besides the knowledge in essential design fields such as visual perception, coding, or the creative process, is the wide range of tools that we have been using within the different projects. I am sure some of them I would have find them anyway sooner or later for belonging to the group of common tools in web design, but some others I find them really powerful and unique that probably would never have come across them, and I would have lost a big bunch of resources that I would be happy to find again when I check back my works in the future. 
I compiled them all into bookmarks, some of them include software like **GitHub** or **SourceTree**, **Mou**, **Slack** or **Trello**. Some web tools and libraries that I kept are **Google Fonts**, **Normalize.css** or **Animate.css**, but the ones I found the most useful and especially like are:

* <a href="http://flukeout.github.io/">CSS dinner</a> CSS exercise to work with different selectors
* <a href="http://alefeuvre.github.io/foundation-grid-displayer/">Grid displayer</a> Displays the columns grid for a website
* <a href="https://thimble.mozilla.org/">Thimble</a> Online code editor from Mozilla
* <a href="http://dillinger.io/">Dillinger</a> Online code files converter
