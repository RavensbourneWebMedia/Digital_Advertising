## WEB14103 - Web Design Principles 

##### Name: Ajay Dhillon

##### Course: BA (Hons) Web Media, Level 1

##### Unit Code: WEB14103

This document will give you an insight of my work throughtout the first half of the year. You will see what the projects I was a part of were about and where you are able to find the work that I produced. 

My first project to begin the course with was Eyeboming which I completed with Malore and Afsara. The actual task was the go out searching for things in everyday life that resembeled a face. Faces in Places. We took images in and around the Greenwich Peninsula and within Ravensbourne. You are able to find all the images that I have taken on my Github repository here:

Back when the internet first came around web pages where very static, for us to understand out next project would demonstrate this to us.This team project is about about symbols and brands. By designing flags, you will devise symbols to represent identities and convert ideas into shapes. One tweet was getting a tweet of your choice which had some meaning and making images in illustrator to exaggerate them into shapes and brands. We were giving a set of rules to follow to see what we could come up with. Research is what gave me ideas to create some of the work that I did which is demonstrated in the presentation thats been created. All this work is depositied on Github:

Our next project was union hack which I was assigned in a group with Tom and Darren. Within this topic we had to create mashups of flags of our choice. I had chosen to use the American, Indian and UAE flags as well as includng the colours from the emotion guide. You will find that I've created the same flag again and again but, I have changed it slightly so I was able to pick which ones worked best. The second part was to create a flag that would be a for a made up destination or meaning of your choice. I am very fond of travelling and that is what lead me to create the image that I did. Which can be found on my repository on Github:

Finally, our last topic for this term was our recipes. These included a set of rules and instructions of food recipes that where coded on Mou using small amounts of HTML. We had to included a table of nutritional information, step by step guide and a list of ingredients. To make the recipe more attractive we then transfered the code into Thimble, which is an online Mozilla owned code editor. This allowed me to experiment more HTML and allowed to me include some CSS which I had learnt about in a previous presentation. I used CSS code that I had found on the internet which I have manipulated to make match my work. You can find the code for my recipe here:

Throughout the term, week after week we were given blogs to talk about regarding what we have done during that lecture or work that had to be comepleted in our own time. I have completed all my blogs and they can be found on my wordpress site that I have create specially for this purpose. I've never used Wordpress before and I found it a mini challenage which I have successfully overcome.

Over the first term we as a class were set tasks within groups to create and present a topic related to the course. A collection of the presentations that I was apart of can all be found on the github repository that I have created:

#### Formative Assessment
For the formative assessment I was required to present the three projects that I was apart of at that time. These included One Tweet, Union Hack and Eyebombing, I created different variations of each of them and presented them on a keynote document.

Unfortunatly, I wasn't aviabiale to attend the assessment lecture so I had to create a presentation at home with me talking about my work on it. You can see my presentation here on Youtube:

#### Summative Assessment
The summative assesment included the best work that I had created. I had chosen to present the best work I've done so far on Eyebombing, One Tweet and Union Hack. The presentation that I built for the assessment can be found on the internet on slides:
