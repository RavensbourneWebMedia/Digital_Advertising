## The Union Hack:  

In this *project*, our aim was to devise symbols to represent identities and convert ideas into shapes. For this, I decided that I would create a planning process which would then lead up to a set of two flag mashups and then finally, my own concept.

Below, is a list of links directing you to the project material in order of completion.

### My Concept - Black Lives Matter 

When creating this *concept*, I wanted to follow the conventions of a flag which was to keep it simple but to remain prominent and effective. Seeing as the topic surrounds the nature of killings in america involving young black teenagers, I felt as though the colour red was essential to cover both the country in which it is happening in and a metaphor for blood. Below is both the link to the concept material and an image to the final flag choice.

##One Tweet:

One tweet was a project which felt to me almost as if I was producing a strict brief piece but which allowed me to stem my creativity. For this project, I used Adobe Illustrator mixing colours, fonts and sizes to create a mixture of feelings within context of my topics. As part of this project, I chose a tweet made by usher on October 14th which said: *"Is the system broken?"*. 

###Links to project material:

First I began with a very simple concept of *hierarchy*. This was shown through the ways in which the text was displayed on the typography poster. 

* [First Poster - Hierarchy](https://github.com/MelissaBee/Hand-In-Package/blob/master/Poster%201%20copy.jpg)
![Hierarchy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MelissaBee/Hand-In-Package/master/Poster%201%20copy.jpg)

Then, I continued by displaying a metaphor of a *'shattered'* community using the letters and displacing them to give this effect. 

* [Second Poster - Shattered](https://github.com/MelissaBee/Hand-In-Package/blob/master/Poster%202%20copy.jpg)
![Shattered](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MelissaBee/Hand-In-Package/master/Poster%202%20copy.jpg)

For this poster, I decided to project the text in a circle shape to convey the metaphor of a *community together in unison*. The edgy text also represented the sharp objects used to cause pain to these families 

* [Third Poster - Community](https://github.com/MelissaBee/Hand-In-Package/blob/master/Poster%203%20copy.jpg)
![Community](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MelissaBee/Hand-In-Package/master/Poster%203%20copy.jpg)

Within this concept, I was really trying to bring through the idea of *rivalry* and *conflict* within the text. Having the text against each other, is like a connotation for the police against the community.   

* [Fourth Poster - Conflict](https://github.com/MelissaBee/Hand-In-Package/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202015-10-20%20at%2019.24.20.png)
![Conflict](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MelissaBee/Hand-In-Package/master/Screen%20Shot%202015-10-20%20at%2019.24.20.png)

As part of this concept, I wanted to create something that now included an extra colour which could *reflect* that extra purpose. I used the shape of an exclamation mark and text in different shapes and sizes and then I lowered the *opacity* of the exclamation mark outline and created this poster as seen below. 

* [Fifth Poster - Exclamation](https://github.com/MelissaBee/Hand-In-Package/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202015-10-27%20at%2022.20.12.png)
![Final Poster 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MelissaBee/Hand-In-Package/master/Screen%20Shot%202015-10-27%20at%2022.20.12.png)

Finally, after collating a story with my typography poster I thought my last idea would be most relevant to all the topics i tried to incorporate within my previous typography posters. For this, i outlined a broken heart with text using the font Acknowledge which was different to the font Impact regular used before. Here I wanted to express sympathy for those lost and so my colours and text explained itself pretty well.

## Eyebombing 

This project consisted of using my imagination to create a set of pictures which reflect faces without voluntarily changing the position of something to enhance the way it looked. For this, I decided I would collate a variety of images using a *DSLR 700D* focusing on the way a camera angle can impact the way the viewer see's the face you are trying to evoke. For this I went to practice in areas around Stratford, University and home. This was three different locations and so my *inspiration* was very widely used and there was no specific theme to the photos - I just freely took as many as I liked.

Before beginning the photography process, I experimented with my phone taking photos of my surroundings around university, taking inspiration from the objects around me for this project.

## Code In Your Plate

This project allowed me to pick a recipe of my choice and code it using HTML and CSS. This means I was able to use a responsive, colourful and creative recipe to inform others on how to cook a favourite meal of mine. I have completed two recipes; one for practice and then the other using a little bit more technicality using the tricks I learnt throughout lectures. 

First, I began with a process which was quite basic, bullet points, change of colour and font and the page was static which meant it didn't fit all types of sizes. When opening the file in different sizes, it was not responsive and so It wasn't enough for what I though I could achieve. Below, are both links to the recipe's I have created.
