# WEB14103: Web Design Principles

### Name: Francisco Figueira

### Student No: 96291215

### Course: BA (Hons) Web Media, Level 1.

### Unit Code: WEB14103

## Introduction

During the first term, I was able to develop many projects while being part of the course entitled as Web Design Principles, run by Matteo Menapace.The course helped me perceive a range of skills to actually know how to develop my ideas and get my message well delivered through visual elements, and also apply that knowledge to create and innovate in the web.I have collaborated in a few enriching projects that brought me more confidence and knowledge about photography, typography, design and coding for web using HTML and responsive CSS. We had a continuous process, covering the most relevant topics, so that I could have a good background and a linear process afterwards. Some of them were published on GitHub as blogs, to make it pleasant for everyone to read, sharing the content and explaining how it was developed, step by step.I also had the opportunity to do some projects in group, which allowed me to know how to work as a team and make that big step in the industry as a web designer.

The achievements that were gained can be seen
