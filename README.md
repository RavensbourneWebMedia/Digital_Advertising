# Projects

### EyeBombing

This **team project** is about *looking* and *creating images*. Looking at everyday objects and our surroundings with different eyes and using **photography** to frame them, so that others can see what we want them to see.

All the project material is [here](projects/eye-bombing).

### OneTweet

This project is about about **typography** and creating *meaning with text*.

All the project material is [here](projects/one-tweet).

### The Union Hack

This **team project** is about about **symbols** and **brands**. By designing flags, you will devise symbols to represent identities and convert ideas into shapes. 

All the project material is [here](projects/union-hack).

### Code in your plate

This project introduces you to **coding** as a process of *translation*: from ideas to words, from words to sketches, from sketches to technical descriptions in various languages. 

You will get familiar with 2 of the 3 languages of the Web: **HTML** and **CSS** (JavaScript next term).

All the project material is [here](projects/code-in-your-plate).


# Learning goals

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. Use your web-skills to make a **whole marketing campaign** conveying one strong storytelling message. 
* Extend initial knowledge of advertising and marketing to create integratied ideas and concepts for conventional and new media applications.
* Show self-initiative and develop good judgement in the presentation of work to a high professional standard that balances academic and competition requirements.
* Develop editorial judgement on the selection of ideas, platform and approach for commercial use.
* Ability to design an integrated solution that combines ideas with cross-media strategies, Web 2.0 and traditional technologies in a compelling integrated campaign.
* Apply art-direction and copywriting skills associated with advertising and marketing to your web based projects.



# Rules of the road

* **Be present**. If you happen to be late or absent, make sure you email me about it before a session starts. 
* **Participate** in class lectures, tutorials and workshops. We'll make sure that your ideas have space to be heard and that nobody makes you feel uncomfortable about sharing them.
* **Present** your work during formative and summative assessments. If you can't make it those days then you'll record your presentation and upload it to YouTube (or similar).
* **Be responsible** for what happens in class. Organise with your peers to get class information and material that you may have missed.
* **Meet the deadlines**. If you submit your work after a deadline, your grade will be capped at D- (bare pass).
