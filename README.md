# Rules of the road

* **Be present**. If you happen to be late or absent, make sure you email me about it before a session starts. 
* **Participate** in class lectures, tutorials and workshops. We'll make sure that your ideas have space to be heard and that nobody makes you feel uncomfortable about sharing them.
* **Present** your work during formative and summative assessments. If you can't make it those days then you'll record your presentation and upload it to YouTube (or similar).
* **Be responsible** for what happens in class. Organise with your peers to get class information and material that you may have missed.
* **Meet the deadlines**. If you submit your work after a deadline, your grade will be capped. Please see the brief for new details.
