# The Degree Show

The Ravensbourne Degree Show 2018 will be June. There will be a Web Media private view as part of the degree show. 

The degree show standard is very high across the university and last years web media year made a real impression with a branded room top to toe. 

There is Ravensbourne budget to help put up your stands and set up the room so I would like to propose that we work together to design the room for this year.

Are any of these roles positions that you would consider for the future? 

### Tutorials: Elevator Pitches, Pitch Documents and Moodboards. 

For the rest of the session I will do one on one tutorials for everyone working on a separate brief. 

Please have the following ready for your tutorial:

* Your chosen Brief (locked down now)
* Your top 3 concepts from last week. 
* Your elevator pitches.
* Your Pitch Documents/One Pagers. 
* Your Moodboards. 

If would like some more time to work on these docs, let me know any you can have your tutorial in one of the later slots. 
 

# Homework

It’s time to start researching your target market (if you haven’t already) and to extend your research further if you already have some insights. 

Each brief set by industry should have some insight into who they want you to target. If not, now is your time to decide who you will make your campaigns for.

#### Some useful pointers / questions to ask yourself might be: 

* **Understand the problem that you solve.** Take another look at your campaign or product and ask, “what problem does this solve?” Once you have this, then start to think about who might be suffering from that problem? In what scenarios?
* **Paint a picture of the customer.** Start to list all of the different types of people who might suffer from your problem and then try and build up a picture of those people. Do they play golf? **nope** Do they live in a flat share in Bristol? **Yep** Are they married? Do they shop at Asda? Ect...
* Now you have a few people with characteristics, think **to whom will this problem be the most troublesome?** **who will loose the most by not solving this problem?** Start to write scenarios for these people. 
* Now you know a little about your audience on the outside, think about the inside. **How do these people think about themselves?** Are they money conscious? Fashion conscious? What motivates them? 

By answering these questions we should be able to build up an idea of who our target market are as people. Now think...

* Where can i find these people? Physically in the world.. Where might they work or hang out? 
* What magazines, online forums or newspapers might they read? In paper form? Or online? 
* What applications might they have on their phone? 
* What shops might they go to? 
* **How will you reach them with your campaign?**

### Blog 

**Individually**, watch the TED talk [Rory Sutherland, life Lessons of an Ad Man](https://www.ted.com/talks/rory_sutherland_life_lessons_from_an_ad_man#t-976494) and blog about:

* How can value be added to products by changing the product itself?
* How can value be added to products by changing thier perception?
* What is badge value and how can this be used to change the value of a product?
* How can peoples actions be nudged by a products design or interface? 
* What are your opinions about Rory Sutherlands TED presentation?
