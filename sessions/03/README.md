# 12 Digital Advertising Concepts

![](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/Digital_Advertising_2018/19/sessions/03/assets/Ideation.jpg)

Last week you were given a sketchnoting grid and the challenge of coming up with 12 core advertising ideas for your brief, one idea for each slot on your grid to be illustrated and annotated to show your thinking. 

# How to make Decisions

Indecisiveness has always been part of the human condition.

Ancient peoples used esoteric methods to try to see into the future, but we now know that there are other ways to make informed choices - by creating a range of options and systematically evaluating them. This is what decision matrices help us to achieve in a design process. 

There are many different forms of decision matrices, but they are all based on having an initial set of criteria against which to evaluate our choices. 

![](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/Digital_Advertising_2018/19/sessions/03/assets/Decision_Matrix-Small.png)

Regarding its physical form, a decision matrix is a table. In the row headings. we have our criteria, in the column headings, we have the concepts we are comparing. Once these are filled each concept can be ranked based on how well it performs against the specified criteria to help aid our choice of which concept to take forwards.  

 Importantly the highest score does not necessarily win - the decision matrix is a tool, not a magic wand. The final decision may be to choose one concept but improve its weakest aspects or combine it with another concept that is stronger on other criteria.

## Class Exercise

In this workshop, you will create a decision matrix (Add matrices link here) to help choose between a range of design concepts. (Tip: You could also use this in your FMP)

**Step 1:** Generate a list of criteria to rate your concepts against, based on the specifics of your brief. If you need to, take a look over your brief again to pull out the core points you were asked to consider?  

* **The tasks requirements:** Does your concept fit with the client brief? How?  
* **Target Audience:** Will your core idea resonate with your target audience? Why?  
* **Feasibility:** Could you realistically see your brand adopting this direction? 
* **Is your concept remarkable?** Remember Seth Godin’s TED talk? Will your concept get people talking? Commenting? Sharing? 

Consider how you might measure these criteria - are they objective or subjective? [10 mins]

**Step 2:** List all of your criteria in the first column of the decision matrix, in order of priority. You should have at least five to perform a successful evaluation. [5 minutes]

**Step 3:** Write your design concepts across the top row of the decision matrix, one in each column. [5 mins or less]

**Step 4:** Add weightings. Are certain criteria more important to the success of the concept than others? These could be weighted more heavily. [5 minutes] 

**Step 5:** Add up the totals, to see which design concept scores the most highly. You could choose the most high-scoring one or combine the best aspects from several concepts to form a new concept before moving forwards. [5 minutes]

# My Burberry Lecture

![](Add image here)

This weeks lecture will focus on The My Burberry Campaign and it's touchpoints. To contextualise this campaign against our study we will look at a the core steps of the campaign and talk though:

The target audience/audiences for the campaign.
The campaign idea. The core creative concept including the campaign slogan.
The core camapign touch points.
The digital touch points for this camapgin and how to explain these ideas with a combination of text & visuals.




# Target Market Insight

![](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/Digital_Advertising_2018/19/sessions/03/assets/Target_Market.jpg)

Last week part of your homework was to review your research folder, focus in on your Target Market research and collect the motivations, behaviours, drivers, habits and hangouts of your target audience to share with the class. 

Let's take 5 mins to collect our insights for each of our projects - teams you may work in pairs here. 

Let's split into groups who are considering each brief, Pearsons, Burger King, Addidas and Bacardi and work together to brainstorm insights on each sheet of paper. [15 mins]

We will pool these with the class at the end of the exercise. 

Time to wrap up our brainstroms and share.

# The Degree Show

![](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/master/sessions/03/Degree_Show_1_Small.png)

The Ravensbourne Degree Show 2018 will be June. There will be a Web Media private view as part of the degree show. 

The degree show standard is very high across the university and last years web media year made a real impression with a branded room top to toe. 

There is Ravensbourne budget to help put up your stands and set up the room so I would like to propose that we work together to design the room for this year.

[Advertising Agencies: The Creative Process](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/Digital_Advertising_2017/18/sessions/03/The%20Creative%20Process_2017:18.pdf)


Let's take a break!

# Advertising Agency Structure

![](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/master/sessions/03/870da9848fc31d087826c9a719305977.jpg)

Our second mini lecture will outline the main departments, job roles and key responsibilities undertaken within most advertising agencies. 

[The Advertising Agency](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/Digital_Advertising_2017/18/sessions/03/The%20Advertising-Agency.pdf)

Are any of these roles positions that you would consider for the future? 

### Tutorials: Elevator Pitches, Pitch Documents and Moodboards. 

For the rest of the session I will do one on one tutorials for everyone working on a separate brief. 

Please have the following ready for your tutorial:

* Your chosen Brief (locked down now)
* Your top 3 concepts from last week. 
* Your elevator pitches.
* Your Pitch Documents/One Pagers. 
* Your Moodboards. 

If would like some more time to work on these docs, let me know any you can have your tutorial in one of the later slots. 
 

# Homework














<!--- 

It’s time to start researching your target market (if you haven’t already) and to extend your research further if you already have some insights. 

Each brief set by industry should have some insight into who they want you to target. If not, now is your time to decide who you will make your campaigns for. 

![](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/master/sessions/03/Magritte_TheSonOfMan.jpg )

#### Some useful pointers / questions to ask yourself might be: 

* **Understand the problem that you solve.** Take another look at your campaign or product and ask, “what problem does this solve?” Once you have this, then start to think about who might be suffering from that problem? In what scenarios?
* **Paint a picture of the customer.** Start to list all of the different types of people who might suffer from your problem and then try and build up a picture of those people. Do they play golf? **nope** Do they live in a flat share in Bristol? **Yep** Are they married? Do they shop at Asda? Ect...
* Now you have a few people with characteristics, think **to whom will this problem be the most troublesome?** **who will loose the most by not solving this problem?** Start to write scenarios for these people. 
* Now you know a little about your audience on the outside, think about the inside. **How do these people think about themselves?** Are they money conscious? Fashion conscious? What motivates them? 

By answering these questions we should be able to build up an idea of who our target market are as people. Now think...

* Where can i find these people? Physically in the world.. Where might they work or hang out? 
* What magazines, online forums or newspapers might they read? In paper form? Or online? 
* What applications might they have on their phone? 
* What shops might they go to? 
* **How will you reach them with your campaign?**

### Blog 

**Individually**, watch the TED talk [Rory Sutherland, life Lessons of an Ad Man](https://www.ted.com/talks/rory_sutherland_life_lessons_from_an_ad_man#t-976494) and blog about:

* How can value be added to products by changing the product itself?
* How can value be added to products by changing thier perception?
* What is badge value and how can this be used to change the value of a product?
* How can peoples actions be nudged by a products design or interface? 
* What are your opinions about Rory Sutherlands TED presentation?
