In last weeks homework you were asked to bring the following for this weeks session: 

1. The Fonts that will be the backbone of your branding
2. Colour pallets - what will your core colours be? 
3. Image mood boards to give an idea of brand treatment. 
4. Any indication of models/images.
5. Any logos that will feature in your camapign. 

How many people have these assets with them for this week? If not you can work with my files and create the same design as me.

Let's start by talking about [colour and printing](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/Digital_Advertising_2018/19/sessions/06/assets/Web_Media_Campaign_Branding_Booklet.pdf) quickly. 

## Touch point & Campaign Plan review

Now that you have seen how to lay out the Campaign Branding Booklet, I would like to touch base with you about your camapign touch points and campaign plans. Please take me through each of these in your 10 min tutorial. These must be crystal clear for summative hand in. 

## Complex digital touch point

Your Digital Advertising Brief says you have to have 1 innovativeÂ web based touch point as part of your campaign.

In this workshop we will plan out this innovative web based touch point step by step so that it is clear what this adds to your camapign & so that we can visualise this clearly in your Campaign Branding Booklet. Please take some post it notes. :) 

# Homework

1. Continue on from today's Camapgin Branding Booklet workshop and lay out your own design. Make sure that you answer each part of the brief as you work with your 12 pages: 

* Detail of the three remarkable advertising campaigns chosen as part of your holiday research. 
* Detail of your initial 12 concepts for your campaign. 
* Detail of the concepts you chose to develop further and why (clear editorial decision making should be shown here). * Campaign mood boarding.

* Detail of your campaign touch point development, both physical and digital and why these are appropriate for target audience and campaign.
