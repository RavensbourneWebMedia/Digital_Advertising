# Review: Hand Ins for Course & D&AD

We have talked briefly about a research folder that should accompany your project work. 

Let's look at some examples from last years students. 


# Tutorials 

I would like to dedicate the rest of the session to tutorials. 

Let's try and see everyone before the end of the session. 

We will be reviewing the work that we have been doing each week on the course including:

1. **Initial Concepts** and how these developed into your final idea. How these relate to your brief. 
* **Pitch documents** or **one pagers.**
* **Moodboards** and how you planned a visual identity.  
* **Target Market Research** and how this has educated you about your audience.  
* **Campaign Plans** and how your media will work acrss both channels, territories and time. 
* Any **articles** that have helped inform your work. 
* **Campaign identity** including colour pallets, fonts, layouts, media chioces, grahic style and image making. 

### Homework & ### Blog (Combined this week)

You have 14 days until summative. Lets really step up a gear and focus on what you want to achieve with the rest of the unit. 

In order to do this, we are going to use a [**productivity planner**](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/master/sessions/08/Productivity%20Planner.pdf)

* Task one: Read the proudctivity planner above. 
* Use the sheets at the end of the pack to plan out tasks for each of the days of the next week. Make these achievable tasks. Some easy, some hard. 
* Each day work through the tasks you have set yourself. Asign any incomplete tasks to another day. 

**Blog**

* Blog about what you have planned for each day of the week. Add the sheets that you have set yourself. 
* Reflect at the end of the week about this process, did it work well? Not so well?
* Reflect on what you achieved this week on your project. How and what did you push forwards?
