# Review: Hand Ins for Course & D&AD

We have talked briefly about a research folder that should accompany your project work. 

Let's look at some examples from last years students. 


# Tutorials 

I would like to dedicate the rest of the session to tutorials. 

Let's try and see everyone before the end of the session. 

We will be reviewing the work that we have been doing each week on the course including:

1. **Initial Concepts** and how these developed into your final idea. How these relate to your brief. 
* **Pitch documents** or **one pagers.**
* **Moodboards** and how you planned a visual identity.  
* **Target Market Research** and how this has educated you about your audience.  
* **Campaign Plans** and how your media will work acrss both channels, territories and time. 
* Any **articles** that have helped inform your work. 
* **Campaign identity** including colour pallets, fonts, layouts, media chioces, grahic style and image making. 

# Homework

### Peer-learning: **CSS tricks**!

On the Google document I emailed you (you can also find it on Slack), there's a new table called **CSS tricks** for you to learn and teach next week.

Your team **mini-lesson** should be **~15 minutes** and include:

* One or more **remixable demos** of your trick on [Thimble](https://thimble.mozilla.org/)
* A quick **explanation** of your trick, preferably as an HTML5 presentation (you can use [slides.com](https://slides.com) for that)
* BONUS: **live examples** of your trick in action in other websites
* A **quiz** for your audience (you can use [Kahoot](https://getkahoot.com/) for that)

##### Tricks 

1. How to use `color` and `background-color` to enhance the behaviour of elements in different states: `hover`, `focus`, `active` and `visited`.

	Include transparency, aka `rgba`.  
* How to style elements to look and feel like *clickable things* (usually referred to as *buttons*), including but not limited to CSS properties like `border` and `border-radius`.
* How to use `position: fixed;` to make elements stick to the page (not scroll away). 
* How to use `relative` and `absolute` `position`ing to control elements precisely (to the pixel). 
	
	Example:
	
	```html
	<div class="container">
		<div class="content">
		</div>
	</div>
	```
	
	```css
	.container {
		position: relative;
	}
	
	.content {
		position: absolute;
		top: 0;
		left: 20px;
	}
	```
* How to centre elements horizontally, including but not limited to CSS properties like `display` and `margin: auto`.
* How to use CSS `transition`s.
* How to use animation libraries like [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css).  
* How to use vector icons from [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome).  

<!--
* animation
* styling form elements
* flex-box
* float?
* class vs id
* overriding rules with specificity 
* How to use negative `margin` to centre elements horizontally and / or vertically. 
* display: inline and block, inline-block

### Blog

Continue working on [Code in your plate](../../projects/code-in-your-plate) and blog about it:

* Write about your **design process**. What inspires you, what do you want to achieve?
* Write about your **coding process**. How are you translating your design ideas into code? What and how are you learning?
