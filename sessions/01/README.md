# A Brief History of Advertising

### Looking before creating

One of the key skills of a designer is the ability to look at what surrounds you and **see the possibilities** for how things can be *framed*. By *training your mind* to see these possibilities, you'll be able to recognise them when you're out with your camera. 

> One should not only photograph something for what it is, but also for **what else** it is.

> [Minor White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_White), photographer

### What else could this be?

When you're about to snap a picture, or when browsing through images, always ask yourself: 

*What else could this be?* 


### How do we *see*? 

![](assets/apple-eye.png)

<!--[The Stage Theory Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson–Shiffrin_memory_model):-->

1. **Notice**   
	
	Our senses pick up **stimuli** and pass them on to the brain. 
	
	In the case of vision, **light** enters our eyes and stimulates our **retina**. Notice how light that comes from the *top* of our vision field will make an impression at the *bottom* of our retina.
	
	The optic nerve attached to the retina transfers that *raw data* to the brain.	
2. **Make sense**  
	
	It is the brain that *flips* visual back to their natural orientation, to form *images* and **make sense** of what surrounds us.
	
	When data has entered the brain, we have the option to discard it or continue thinking about it. Information stays for about 20-30 seconds in *short-term memory* before it is either forgotten or passed on to *long-term memory*.

### What is the difference between *seeing* and *looking*?
	
You should watch the series [Ways of Seeing](https://youtu.be/XShzabEv8bM?t=2m37s) by John Berger (and/or read [the book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ways_of_Seeing)). All the following quotes come from the book.
	
> Seeing comes before words. The child looks and recognises before it can speak.

We *see* with our eyes but we *make sense* of it with our brains. 

Looking is the result of an **active decision**. We decide what to look at and what to ignore.

> Each evening we *see* the sun set. We *know* that the earth is turning away from it. Yet the knowledge, the explanation, never quite fits the sight. 

### How does our brain *make sense* of the things we see?

[![](assets/apples-cranach.jpg)](http://courtauld.ac.uk/gallery/collection/paintings/renaissance/lucas-cranach-the-elder-adam-and-eve)

Are these apples? How do you [know](http://courtauld.ac.uk/gallery/collection/paintings/renaissance/lucas-cranach-the-elder-adam-and-eve)?

* Habit
* Convention
* Past experiences
* Mental models
* Context
* Contrast (noticeable differences)
* Culture
* Taste

> Looking is less spontaneous and natural than we tend to believe [...] The way we see things is affected by what we *know* or what we *believe*.


<!-- > We never look at just one thing; we are always looking at the **relation between things and ourselves**. -->

<!-- > But there is also another sense in which seeing comes before words. It is seeing which establishes our place in the
surrounding world; we explain that world with words, but words can never undo the fact that we are surrounded by it. -->


### What is an *image*?

A large percentage of what we see on a daily basis are not first-hand impressions, but *images*.

[![](assets/pipe-magritte.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images)

> An image is a sight that has been **recreated** or reproduced.
	
### Can you see the similarities between an *eye* and a *camera*?

Why is it called [*camera*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_obscura) btw?

[![](assets/camera-obscura.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_obscura)

<!--https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Camera_obscura2.jpg#/media/File:Camera_obscura2.jpg-->

### Do you *take* a photograph or *make* a photograph?

> Every image embodies a way of seeing. Even a photograph. For photographs are not, as is often assumed, a mechanical record. Every time we look at a photograph, we are aware, however slightly, of the photographer selecting that sight from an infinity of other **possible sights**.

<!--### How do we create images?

* What are you looking at?
* How do you look at things?
* How do you want things to be looked at?
* What do you look like?
* What is the relationship between what you see and what you make? What you make and how you are seen?-->

# Workshop

Let's get started by choosing one of the 16 D&AD briefs and leaning how to break down the brief. 

![alt text](assets/How_To_Break_Down_A_Brief.jpg)

Briefs are essential but they can be overwhelming, so lets deconstruct our brief so get to the **heart** of what we're being asked for. 

Before we start, read your brief one more time so it's fresh in your mind. 

Task 1: 5 Mins

Reread your brief but think about the **essential** points are, what **specific words communicate** and key pieces of info that **stand out**. Highlight them.

You are not going to break down the brief into just 16 words. These 16 words should communicate what the brief is asking you to do. Imagine you are giving this to someone instead of the full brief. How can you get them to understand what the task is in the same way but in only 16 words? Pull in any of the specific info or words you highlighted to help you.

Note down your 16 words only. 

Task 2: 2 Mins

From your 16 words, really think again about what the **crucial points** are.

How many words could you shave and still communicate what the brief is asking you to do?

Let's try do it in 8? Ok, let's do it. 

In 8 words, what is the brief asking you to do? Rearrange the ones you have, use 8 new words or mix it up.

Step 3: 1 Mins

So now you've got it down to the bare bones right? Those 8 words are all gold and they are completely vital. But which ones could you do without?

Try and get it down to just 4 words. Remember, you are trying to communicate as much of the information from the full brief as possible. 

Think about which words carry the most meaning.

Step 4: 1 Mins

What next? Let's slim it down to 2 words.



### GitHub 

Check out [this handy guide](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Guides/blob/master/how-to-git.md) on *what* Git is, *how* it works and *why* you should use it.

It boils down to a couple of things:

* **Organisation**: keeping backed up versions of your work.
* **Collaboration**: working on the same projects with many other people (*many* can mean thousands) effectively.

### MarkDown

MarkDown (MD) is the default rich-text format on GitHub.

What does **marking up** mean?
