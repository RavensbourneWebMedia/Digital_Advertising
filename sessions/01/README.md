Over the holidays you were set a task: To watch [Seth Godins Ideas Worth Spreading](https://www.ted.com/talks/seth_godin_on_sliced_bread) and bring the following to the first session to present to class: 

* 3 advertising campaigns that you think are remarkable
* Your justification for choosing these projects (why do they stand out to you)

Let's share these projects with the class to cover a range of contemporary advertising campaigns. 

Who would like to be first to present? 

# Industry Briefs for the Unit

![Lightbulb moment](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/Digital_Advertising_2018/19/sessions/01/assets/Lightbulb.jpg)

This year you will respond to one of four briefs set by industry, these are: 

1. [The Adidas Brief](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/Digital_Advertising_2018/19/sessions/01/assets/adidas_Brief_New_Blood_Awards_2018.pdf)
2. [The Barcardi Brief](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/Digital_Advertising_2018/19/sessions/01/assets/Bacardi_Brief_New_Blood_Awards_2018.pdf)
3. [The Burger King Brief](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/Digital_Advertising_2018/19/sessions/01/assets/Burger_King_Brief_New_Blood_Awards_2018.pdf)
4. [The Pearsons Brief](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/Digital_Advertising_2018/19/sessions/01/assets/Pearson_Brief_New_Blood_Awards_2018.pdf)

Let's take 3 mins and read through brief each. I'll number each student and you can read through the corresponding brief. 

Now let's share each brief with the class. Who will share brief 1? 

Now that we've all shared the briefs we will need to decide which to answer before moving forwards. Look at the key points in the brief and the target audeince and think, which will give you the most creative scope moving forwards? Which appeals to you most? 

10mins to decide on your brief. 

<!---
**Note**, some may be more relevant than others as we will be working toward making a **digital campaign or product** as a response. 

**Discussion**

Now that we have heard each brief, which will you choose? Consider:

* Which briefs spark ideas in your minds / seem to be engaging? Advertising is all about the creative idea!
* Which briefs call for a digial response? Are there any breifs that rules this out? 



**Words of Wisdon**

Wise words from previous advertising industry professionals tackeling D&AD briefs:

1. **The idea is King.** Spent time thinking about what to suggest for your brief. 
2. **Treat Tech with Caution.** This will be key for us as our responses will be digital. Let's make sure we have good reasons for using the web / mobile app / online platforms. Explain these clearly. 
3. **Tell A Story** Stories are a powerful tool in human communication. Tap into this wherever possible with your campaign. 

We will touch on these points in more depth later in the course but using these early to help craft your concepts will be useful. 

# Workshop: Breaking Down A Brief

Let's get started by choosing one of the briefs and leaning how to break down the brief. The brief you choose doesn't have to be your final choice!

![alt text](assets/How_To_Break_Down_A_Brief.jpg)

Briefs are essential but they can be overwhelming, so lets deconstruct our brief so get to the **heart** of what we're being asked for. 

Before we start, read your brief one more time so it's fresh in your mind. 

## Task 1: 5 Mins

Reread your brief but think about the **essential** points are, what **specific words communicate** and key pieces of info that **stand out**. Highlight them.

You are now going to break down the brief into just 16 words. These 16 words should communicate what the brief is asking you to do. Imagine you are giving this to someone instead of the full brief. How can you get them to understand what the task is in the same way but in only 16 words? Pull in any of the specific info or words you highlighted to help you.

Note down your 16 words only. 

## Task 2: 2 Mins

From your 16 words, really think again about what the **crucial points** are.

How many words could you shave and still communicate what the brief is asking you to do?

Let's try do it in 8? Ok, let's do it. 

In 8 words, what is the brief asking you to do? Rearrange the ones you have, use 8 new words or mix it up.

## Task 3: 1 Mins

So now you've got it down to the bare bones right? Those 8 words are all gold and they are completely vital. But which ones could you do without?

Try and get it down to just 4 words. Remember, you are trying to communicate as much of the information from the full brief as possible. 

Think about which words carry the most meaning.

## Task 4: 1 Mins

What next? Let's slim it down to 2 words.

Now you have your whole brief squeezed down into 2 words. You have identified the **heart** of your brief. 

It wouldn't be a good idea to use only these words when building your concepts, but now the other words and context of the brief should feel like a luxury. 

As you work on ideas for your brief, refer back and ask, "Is my idea / campaign communicating the 2 word, **heart** of my brief?"

Now that you have broken down your brief, how do you feel about the brief that you have chosen? Now is the time to stick or twist.

# Homework

## Research Record Folder

As we are following the double diamond for this unit, the focus of this session and the next will be discovery. 

![alt text](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/Digital_Advertising_2018/19/sessions/01/assets/Double-Diamond.png)

Within this stage of a project it is important to research all areas around the brief and subject thoroughly to bring the right insight to our future work, concepts and designs. 

With this in mind, week 1's homework will be to start your research record folder in the library. 

For the next session on **October 15th** you will research and bring ready to share with the class the start of your annotated bibliography including 5 research sources where: 

* 1 must be chosen from the unit reading list. 
* 2 must address current digital trends within the advertising industry. 
* 2 must address insight into the briefs target audience, their motivations, habits, behaviours and drivers.

Each source must be accompanied by **EITHER** a 100min - 200max word summary OR a video explanation (max 1min)detailing the sources contribution to current advertising practice or the value taken from the piece for the students project development.

This task **MUST** be completed by the next session as you will need to share resources with the rest of the class to move forwards. 

Any questions on the task? Would anyone like to talk through their choice? 

<!---

### Blog 

The advertising industry is often a testing ground for the latest innovations and technological advances. In the past this has been chatbots, snapchat,​ geolocation filters, ​virtual​ ​reality​ ​and interactive​ ​billboards but this year these innovations will be different. Search the web and the library high and low for insights into the lastest web based advertising trends. 

Once you have found a pool of innovations, write a blog post detailing everything you've found but featuring your **top 3** web based innovations and how they have been used to sell products by industry. 

Bring your list of innovations to the next session on 15th October.

Sessions 1 and 2 will be research intensive and it's important to lay the foundations of your projects correctly so that you can make camapigns that are targeted and optimised for the intended audeince. 

To get started we will head to the Library for the last 30mins of the session on how to use Ravensbournes digial resources to research your target audeince. 

Let's get going!
