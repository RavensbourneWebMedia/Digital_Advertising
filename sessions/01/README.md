# Welcome

1. [What is this course about?](../../README.md)
* [What's the plan?](../../README.md#plan) Make sure you subscribe to the [calendar feed](https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/rave.ac.uk_agop0ff7kdgdc289jdrl5021gs%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics)! 
* [What can you learn?](../../README.md#learning-goals)
* Keeping a **journal** to record your creative process is *extremely* important. Don't let your ideas and thoughts fade away! Think of your project blog as your **digital sketchbook**. More on that [here](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Blogging#why-blogging).
* Reading lists and perusing the library (I'll also share some PDFs).


# A Brief History of Advertising

### Looking before creating

One of the key skills of a designer is the ability to look at what surrounds you and **see the possibilities** for how things can be *framed*. By *training your mind* to see these possibilities, you'll be able to recognise them when you're out with your camera. 

> One should not only photograph something for what it is, but also for **what else** it is.

> [Minor White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_White), photographer

### What else could this be?

When you're about to snap a picture, or when browsing through images, always ask yourself: 

*What else could this be?* 


### How do we *see*? 

![](assets/apple-eye.png)

<!--[The Stage Theory Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson–Shiffrin_memory_model):-->

1. **Notice**   
	
	Our senses pick up **stimuli** and pass them on to the brain. 
	
	In the case of vision, **light** enters our eyes and stimulates our **retina**. Notice how light that comes from the *top* of our vision field will make an impression at the *bottom* of our retina.
	
	The optic nerve attached to the retina transfers that *raw data* to the brain.	
2. **Make sense**  
	
	It is the brain that *flips* visual back to their natural orientation, to form *images* and **make sense** of what surrounds us.
	
	When data has entered the brain, we have the option to discard it or continue thinking about it. Information stays for about 20-30 seconds in *short-term memory* before it is either forgotten or passed on to *long-term memory*.

### What is the difference between *seeing* and *looking*?
	
You should watch the series [Ways of Seeing](https://youtu.be/XShzabEv8bM?t=2m37s) by John Berger (and/or read [the book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ways_of_Seeing)). All the following quotes come from the book.
	
> Seeing comes before words. The child looks and recognises before it can speak.

We *see* with our eyes but we *make sense* of it with our brains. 

Looking is the result of an **active decision**. We decide what to look at and what to ignore.

> Each evening we *see* the sun set. We *know* that the earth is turning away from it. Yet the knowledge, the explanation, never quite fits the sight. 

### How does our brain *make sense* of the things we see?

Are these apples? How do you [know](http://courtauld.ac.uk/gallery/collection/paintings/renaissance/lucas-cranach-the-elder-adam-and-eve)?

* Habit
* Convention
* Past experiences
* Mental models
* Context
* Contrast (noticeable differences)
* Culture
* Taste

> Looking is less spontaneous and natural than we tend to believe [...] The way we see things is affected by what we *know* or what we *believe*.


<!-- > We never look at just one thing; we are always looking at the **relation between things and ourselves**. -->

<!-- > But there is also another sense in which seeing comes before words. It is seeing which establishes our place in the
surrounding world; we explain that world with words, but words can never undo the fact that we are surrounded by it. -->


### What is an *image*?

A large percentage of what we see on a daily basis are not first-hand impressions, but *images*.

[![](assets/pipe-magritte.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images)

> An image is a sight that has been **recreated** or reproduced.
	
### Can you see the similarities between an *eye* and a *camera*?

Why is it called [*camera*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_obscura) btw?

[![](assets/camera-obscura.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_obscura)

<!--https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Camera_obscura2.jpg#/media/File:Camera_obscura2.jpg-->

### Do you *take* a photograph or *make* a photograph?

> Every image embodies a way of seeing. Even a photograph. For photographs are not, as is often assumed, a mechanical record. Every time we look at a photograph, we are aware, however slightly, of the photographer selecting that sight from an infinity of other **possible sights**.

<!--### How do we create images?

* What are you looking at?
* How do you look at things?
* How do you want things to be looked at?
* What do you look like?
* What is the relationship between what you see and what you make? What you make and how you are seen?-->


# Intro D&AD Briefs

# Workshop

Let's get started by choosing one of the 16 D&AD briefs and leaning how to deconstuct or break down the brief. 

### GitHub 

Check out [this handy guide](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Guides/blob/master/how-to-git.md) on *what* Git is, *how* it works and *why* you should use it.

It boils down to a couple of things:

* **Organisation**: keeping backed up versions of your work.
* **Collaboration**: working on the same projects with many other people (*many* can mean thousands) effectively.

### MarkDown

MarkDown (MD) is the default rich-text format on GitHub.

What does **marking up** mean?




# Homework

### Brief Breakdown and Ideation

Working on your own or in your chosen group of 2:

Choose an **vD&AD Brief** set by industry from the list below:

1. Adobe
* Amazon
* Arjowiggins
* BBC 
* Crowne Plazaa
* Desperados
* Hasbro
* John Lewis
* Monotype
* MUBI
* Nationwide
* Pearson
* Respect for Animals
* Squarespace
* The British Army
* The National Autistic Society

Or write your own brief and:

1. Create 20 concepts / ideas for a campaign that responds to your chosen brief. 
* Choose the 5 strongest ideas and explain how they "stand out". 
* Detail how these 5 respond to the "heart" of the brief that you've chosen. 
* Bring your 5 ideas ready to explain to the class next week (bearing in mind you will have max 2 minute to explain each idea). 

### Blog 

1. Watch Seth Godin’s TED talk on [**How to get your ideas to spread.**] (https://www.ted.com/talks/seth_godin_on_sliced_bread) and reflect on the content of the lecture and key themes. Note your thoughts on the lecture and how this might relate to your own work. 
* Choose 3 "stand out" digital advertising campaigns and explain what makes them "remarkable" in comparison to other campaigns.
