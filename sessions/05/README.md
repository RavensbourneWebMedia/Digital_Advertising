# Formative Presentations

You will present your digital advertising projects, either individually or in your teams of two. 

You will have 15mins max to present your work.

Remember, this is a formative presentation, which gives you a chance to ask any questions about your work that might help you push forwards over the next 2 weeks.

Explain how your concept relates to your chosen brief and how it appeals to the interests and needs of your target audience.

After each presentation we will give **verbal feedback**.  

Feedback on presentations will be recorded on the [digital advertising google doc.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12cPyW-ZOI4fziQb5RYJZzmJhFBu8N8-pYEK7013Qi6A/edit?usp=sharing)

#### After today

You will recieve written feedback on your hand in, based on your self assessment. This will include the core points from your presentation feedback from the sheet. 

## Self Assessment Exercise

In order to get an understanding of how you see your work, progress and interpretation of the brief, we are asking for your online submission to contain the following: 

1. Part A: Research Record Folder (where the bibliography is 4 x A4 PDF Max and Ravensbourne Referenced and videos are supplied as stand alone files).
2. Work to date on Part B: A Campaign Branding Booklet (12 x A4 PDF Max and supporting files).
3. These hand ins must be accompanied by a [Self Assessment Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TS4FhHuwKvzrDZR76OnVW_2JtJiQcXXGROtAlcdBI-4/edit?usp=sharing) as this will be the basis for tutor formative feedback.

This will correolate with the [UAL Grade descriptors.](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/Digital_Advertising_2018/19/sessions/04/assets/UAL_Marking_Criteria.pdf) 

Please navigate to the self assessment sheet, copy and fill out with short sentence for each point under the marking criteria. Please also give yourself a grade for each hand in point. 

I will then use this as the basis of my feedback and points for improvement. 

## Course Feedback

In order to make the course better we would love to have your honest and professional feedback on the Digital Advertising / Web Media course.
