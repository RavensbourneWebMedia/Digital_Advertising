### Your [homework](#homework) and [blog](#blog)


# Formative assessment

#### Today

You will present your digital advertising projects, either individually or in your teams of two. 

You will have 10mins max to present your work.

Remember, this is a formative presentation, which gives you a chance to ask any questions about your work that might help you push forwards over the next 4 weeks.

Explain how your concept relates to your chosen brief and how it appeals to the interests and needs of your target audience.

After each presentation we will give **verbal feedback**.  

#### After today

We will type up the feedback and share it with you via the Google docs above.

You will reflect on this feedback (*self-assessment*) and write your thoughts in a blog post. 


# Homework

As part of your hand in you will need to make:

A Project/Research Folder (4 x A4 PDF Max - Harvard Referenced) that will include:

Concise documentation outlining the research stages and physical/online reading and campaign references that have contributed to the project.

Over enhancement week, read two articles or book extracts about digital advertising in preparation for this part of your submission. 

### Blog 

1. Reflect on the feedback you received during the formative assessment and write about it. 

Your post should address these questions (in no particular order):

* **ME**:
	* What worked and what didn't when presenting?
	* Did I communicate my ideas clearly to the class, why or why not? 

* My **WORK**:
	* What worked and what didn't?
	* What should I improve for next time?
	* Did the campaign grab the attention of people in the room?
	* How can I make my campaign and pitch have greater impact for summative? 

2. Jot down an action plan for the next 4 weeks (5 including enhancement week): list what you want to do in order to address that feedback that you received. 

3. Plot out the tasks that you have remaining for Summative presentation against the [hand in doc](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/tree/master/projects/union-hack) and plot them against the remianing weeks in the course.
    
    ### For Next Time, Monday 27th November:

	You have time without any lectures which is great to start putting things in place for the next part of term. Whilst you have some time:

	* Do some research into [invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/), sign up and make an account. 
	* Look into design libraries that you can borrow to help design your products or prototypes, like [Facebook](https://en.facebookbrand.com/). Don't reinvent the wheel. 
	* Let me know whether you are interested in being part of the degree show.
