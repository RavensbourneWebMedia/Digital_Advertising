# Formative Presentations

You will present your digital advertising projects, either individually or in your teams of two. 

You will have 15mins max to present your work.

Remember, this is a formative presentation, which gives you a chance to ask any questions about your work that might help you push forwards over the next 2 weeks.

Explain how your concept relates to your chosen brief and how it appeals to the interests and needs of your target audience.

After each presentation we will give **verbal feedback**.  

Feedback on presentations will be recorded on the [digital advertising google doc.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12cPyW-ZOI4fziQb5RYJZzmJhFBu8N8-pYEK7013Qi6A/edit?usp=sharing)

#### After today

You will recieve written feedback on your hand in, based on your self assessment. This will include the core points from your presentation feedback from the sheet. 

## Self Assessment Exercise

In order to get an understanding of how you see your work, progress and interpretation of the brief, we are asking for your online submission to contain the following: 

1. Part A: Research Record Folder (where the bibliography is 4 x A4 PDF Max and Ravensbourne Referenced and videos are supplied as stand alone files).
2. Work to date on Part B: A Campaign Branding Booklet (12 x A4 PDF Max and supporting files).
3. These hand ins must be accompanied by a [Self Assessment Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TS4FhHuwKvzrDZR76OnVW_2JtJiQcXXGROtAlcdBI-4/edit?usp=sharing) as this will be the basis for tutor formative feedback.

This will correolate with the [UAL Grade descriptors.](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/Digital_Advertising_2018/19/sessions/04/assets/UAL_Marking_Criteria.pdf) 

Please navigate to the self assessment sheet, copy and fill out with short sentence for each point under the marking criteria. Please also give yourself a grade for each hand in point. 

I will then use this as the basis of my feedback and points for improvement. 

## Online Uploads

Your deadline today for online uploads is 4pm. Let's work together to make your [formative uploads.](https://moodle.rave.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=126287)

Do you have any questions at all? 

## Course Feedback

In order to make the course better we would love to have your honest and professional feedback on the Digital Advertising / Web Media course. 

I have made a nearpod, a type of interactive presentation, where you can [feed back your throughts.](https://share.nearpod.com/vsph/ca3qCHNgNu) I will ensure that your names aren't visable. Let's take a moment to fill out the feedback. 

Please join with the code: UPGTC

I will take the class question by question. Please give as much context to your answers as possible. 

# Homework

![](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/Digital_Advertising_2018/19/sessions/05/assets/Brand_Guidelines.jpg)

As part of the session next week we will be thinking about laying out your Digital Advertising branding in indesign. This week you should have shown your formative presentation with an inital idea of your branding. 

Now it's time to refine this look and feel as you will need to bring the following for next week: 

1. The Fonts that will be the backbone of your branding
2. Colour pallets - what will your core colours be? 
3. Image mood boards to give an idea of brand treatment. 
4. Any indication of models/images.
5. Any logos that will feature in your camapign. 

We will need these to make your branding next week. Please bring files ready to work.
