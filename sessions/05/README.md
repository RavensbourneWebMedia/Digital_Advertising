# Formative assessment

#### Today

You will present your digital advertising projects, either individually or in your teams of two. 

You will have 10mins max to present your work.

We will give you **verbal feedback** after each round of presentations.  

#### After today

We will type up the feedback and share it with you via the Google docs above.

You will reflect on this feedback (*self-assessment*) and write your thoughts in a blog post. See [more details below]().


# Homework

### Blog 

**Individually**, reflect on the feedback you received during the formative assessment, as well as your experience in this unit so far, and write about it.

Your post should address these questions (in no particular order):

* **ME**:
	* How and what did I learn?
	* What worked and what didn't when presenting?
	* Did I reach my goals, why or why not?  

* My **WORK**:
	* What worked and what didn't?
	* What needs improvement for next time?
	* Did the campaign grab the attention of people in the room?
	* Was there anything that wasn't clear in the work when I presented it?
