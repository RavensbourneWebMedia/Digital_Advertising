# Peer learning

#### 4 teams

One more thing: make your mini-lessons **interactive** (aka *don't recite a presentation*)!

#### Mini-lessons topics

1. **Visual symbols** and their cultural meanings.
* **Visual techniques** (aka *rhetorical devices*) for non-literal communication.
* Designing with **colours**: [how to create your own palette](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/02/color-theory-for-designer-part-3-creating-your-own-color-palettes), even an [edible one](http://idsgn.org/posts/an-edible-color-palette)!
* Websites/apps as extensions of a *brand*: **colours**.
* Websites/apps as extensions of a *brand*: **typography**.

### OneTweet

Interesting patterns that we observed in your projects:

* You mostly chose Ed Snowden's or Ed Ball's tweet. Why?  
 
* You overwhelmingly chose short tweets. Why?

* **Fonts** have a personality. Don't just pick one, try many!  
  
	Try and avoid using default fonts like *Myriad*, *Arial*, *Times New Roman*, *Verdana*, *Trebuchet* and *Comic Sans*.  
  
	Good online sources of fonts: 
	
	* [Font Squirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/)
	* [Adobe Typekit](https://typekit.com)
	* [League of Movable Type](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/)
	* [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts)
	* [Fonts in Use](http://fontsinuse.com/)
	* [Typecast](http://typecast.com/)
	* [Typewolf](https://www.typewolf.com/)
	* [Fontstand](https://fontstand.com/)
	* [WhatFont tool](http://chengyinliu.com/whatfont.html)

* Vertical lettering: it’s hard to read, so think about how effective this is.  
  
	For the final submission, continue to explore **tweet’s meaning(s)** and play with visual **metaphors** and cultural **references**.

* Don't state / illustrate the obvious.

	In Chip Kidd's words:  
  
	> Don't treat people like morons.

### Union Hack

Touching on **branding** elements:

* **Visual grammar**: starting from one element and building lots of variations that are still recognisable as part of the same *family*.   

	
* **Shapes**: make them simple, so that a kid could draw them.

<!--* Symbols  --> 

* **Colours**

	Your composition should work in black/white only.  
  
  	Which of the following don't quite work in b/w?

* **Naming / Languages / Use of Text**  
	
	Make sure you are using the correct language and text!
	
	Use [alliteration](http://robdkelly.com/blog/marketing/alliteration-examples/) when naming your imaginary country / flag.
	
	Test their **memorability**.

### General observations

* Make sure you **read the brief**. Have a version that strictly follows it, and another that pushes the boundaries.

* Be prepared for tech to fail during your presentation. Have a **plan B**.

* **Rehearse** your presentation, don't wing it. 
 
* Don't expect people to know what you're talking about - you need to make your presentations clear, informative and simple without over stating the obvious. 

	Have an **intro** slide/section where you *tell them what you're going to tell them*.

* Explain your process, not just the end results.   
  
	Show us how you got there.

* *Like it / Don't like it* is not professional. It may be ok on FB, but not during a design critique. Rather say 

	> I chose this font (colour, picture, shape, xyz) **because**...

	and after *because* never use *I like it* or *it's interesting*.

# The good, the bad and the ugly

Let's collect shitty design examples on [this Pinterest board](https://uk.pinterest.com/ajacksonbruce/unbelievable-visual-design/).

When adding a pin, add a short explanation of *why this design sucks* and specify which visual design principles (one or more, in any order) your example doesn't follow:

- [ ] There is no *harmony* in this design, because...
- [ ] The *spacing* of elements makes me cringe, because...  
- [ ] The *hierarchy* is off, because...  
- [ ] This design is *unbalanced*, because...
- [ ] The *contrast* is bad, because...
- [ ] *Scale* is used in a weird way, because...
- [ ] The *visually dominant* element is not the right one, because...
- [ ] Elements that should be *similar* are not, because...
- [ ] The *message* is wrong, because...

# Homework

### Peer learning

1. **Publish** your mini-lesson and any other relevant material. We recommend GitHub (we :green_heart: :octocat:) but you can publish elsewhere as long as it's accessible by anyone.

2. Add the link to your mini-lesson (and any other relevant material) to the Google document you can find on Slack.

### Blog 

**Individually**, reflect on your peer learning mini-lesson today, and blog about it.

You can use the questions below as a guide for your blog post.

#### Mini-lesson **content**   
	
1. How did you **plan** your mini-lesson?
* What were the **key points** you wanted to get across?
* How did you decide to communicate them?
* What **assumptions** have you made about what we already know?
* How **interactive** was your mini-lesson? How was the audience meant to *participate*? 
* What **questions** have you planned to ask your audience? How *open* were those questions? What type of questions (*Right-there*, *Between-the-lines* or *Opinion-needed* questions)?
	
#### **Delivery**
	
1. What role did **visuals** (eg: slides, if you had any) play in your mini-lesson?
* What role did each **team member** play in delivering the mini-lesson? 
* How did you **practice** your mini-lesson?
* How did your mini-lesson start? How did you *hook* your audience?
* What was your **body language** like? Consider facial expressions, movements of the arms, eye contact with the audience, and posture.
* What was your **voice** like? Consider speed of delivery, pausing, volume and pitch.

#### What can you **improve**?
