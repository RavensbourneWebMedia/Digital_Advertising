As there was a tube strike last week, I thought that I would quickly go over the deliverables for the course so that we all know what is expected for formative **next week** and summative at the end of term. 

All deliverables for this course can be found on the [Digital Advertising Campaign](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/tree/master/projects/union-hack) page. 


## Multi Channel vs Omni Channel Advertising

This weeks lecture will focus around the differnt types of advertising campagin that include delivery to lots of separate channels. 

To contextualise these practices we will look at two Burberry campaigns and talk though:

1. Their target audiences. 
* Their campaign ideas. The core creative concept including the campaign slogan. 
* Their digital touch points. 
* How to map/communicate ideas for digital touch points. 
* how their campaign plans work across platforms against time.

## Creating a Campaign Plan

An campaign or advertising plan lays out exactly how and when a business will reach out to potential customers through various types of media and how they are connected. 

As we are planning advertising campaigns that will appraoch customers through a variety of channels ( multiple digital, digital and physical, digiatl and print) it's important that we communicate how these threads will pull together to make an integrated campaign. 

Some good questions to ask might be:

1. What media/experience will go out in which channel? 
* How will this work over time? (Will one lead to another? Will they all reinforce each other at the same time? Will there be seasonal variations?) 
* How does your apprach to multiple channels make sense as a whole campaign?

### Blog 

Blog post: Reflect on the the work that you have created so far for the course touching on:

1. Your **20 concepts** and your top 3. Then how you chose your leading idea from your shortlisted 3. 
* The creation of your **elevator pitches:** Did you make more than one revision before reaching your final version? What are you pitches? 
* The creation of your **pitch document / one pager.** How you worked to digitise this after creating a paper sketch. 
* The creation of your **moodboard** and whether this has helped steer the look and feel of your campaign. 
* The **research** that you have gathered on your **target market.** 
* The creation of your **campaign plan.**
