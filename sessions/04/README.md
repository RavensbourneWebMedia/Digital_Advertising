#### Looking back to last week

As there was a tube strike last week, I thought that I would quickly go over the deliverables for the course so that we all know what is expected for formative **next week** and summative at the end of term. 

All deliverables for this course can be found on the [Digital Advertising Campaign](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/tree/master/projects/union-hack) page. 


# Multi Channel vs Omni Channel Advertising

This weeks lecture will focus around the differnt types of advertising campagin that include delivery to lots of separate channels. 

To contextualise these practices we will look at two Burberry campaigns and talk though:

1. Their target audiences. 
* Their campaign ideas. The core creative concept including the campaign slogan. 
* Their digital touch points. 
* How to map/communicate ideas for digital touch points. 
* how their campaign plans work across platforms against time.

# The Degree Show

The Ravensbourne Degree Show 2017 will be June. There will be a Web Media private view as part of the degree show. 

In previous years the web media room has looked a little inconsistant whereas the degree show standard is very high. 

There is Ravensbourne budget to help put up your stands and set up the room so I would like to propose that we work together to design the room for this year.

I have now made a new channel on slack so that we can be in contact about the degree show. If you are interested in taking part, let me know there.

### Blog 

**Individually**, reflect on the feedback you received during the formative assessment, as well as your experience in this unit so far, and write about it.

Your post should address these questions (in no particular order):

* **ME**:
	* How and what did I learn?
	* What worked and what didn't?
	* Did I reach my goals, why or why not?  
	* How did I feel during the process?  

* My **TEAM**:
	* How did the team perform?
	* What worked and what didn't?
	* What can we do better next time?
	* Did the team reach the goal?
	* Was there conflict, how do we fix it?
