#### Looking back to last week

As there was a tube strike last week, I thought that I would quickly go over the deliverables for the course so that we all know what is expected for formative **next week** and summative at the end of term. 

All deliverables for this course can be found on the [Digital Advertising Campaign](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/tree/master/projects/union-hack) page. 


## Multi Channel vs Omni Channel Advertising

This weeks lecture will focus around the differnt types of advertising campagin that include delivery to lots of separate channels. 

To contextualise these practices we will look at two Burberry campaigns and talk though:

1. Their target audiences. 
* Their campaign ideas. The core creative concept including the campaign slogan. 
* Their digital touch points. 
* How to map/communicate ideas for digital touch points. 
* how their campaign plans work across platforms against time.
