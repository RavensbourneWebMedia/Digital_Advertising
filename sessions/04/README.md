## Campaign Touch Points Review

![](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/Digital_Advertising_2018/19/sessions/04/assets/tenor_2.gif)

You were set 2 tasks for [homework](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/tree/Digital_Advertising_2018/19/sessions/03#homework)) Let's share you NEW campaign touch points with the class. :)

## Concept One Pagers

What is a concept one pager for an advertising campaign? 

A one page document summarising your idea visually, so that you can talk about it to anyone.

It typically includes:

1. A catchy title
2. A strapline
3. Your elevator pitch (answers to the questions above)
4. A visualisation of the idea (not necessarily your complete creative but something to contextualise your idea)

Let's see some past student examples :) 

Now let's make our own... First on paper, then you will digitise. You might want to work in indesign to create this docuemnt, there are some hand templates here.

## Formative Hand In Review

Next week our session will focus on feedback. You will recieve formative feedback on your presentations and hand in your work to date as well as having a change to feedback on the course so far. After this session there will be time to address any suggestions, so please get thinking. :) 

In preparation, I thought that I would quickly go over the deliverables for the course so that we all know what is expected for formative **next week**. 

All deliverables for this course can be found on the [Digital Advertising Brief](Add Brief to GIT Here) hosted on Aula.

Next Week for Formative, you will: 

ADD LIST OF TODO's for NEXT WEEK. 

## Campaign Plans: Past Student Work

This week the focus of the session is going to be on the strategy behind your campaign and it's touchpoinct and how a  campaign plan can help you communicate this in a simple and visual way.

Let's take a look at some past student work to see how this has been appraoched in the past. 

## Multi Channel vs Omni Channel Advertising

![](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/Digital_Advertising_2017/18/sessions/04/Omni-channel_image_small.jpg)

This weeks lecture will focus around the differnt types of advertising campagin that include delivery to lots of separate channels. 

To contextualise this practice we will look at a second Burberry campaign and talk though:

* The target audiences. 
* The campaign idea. The core creative concept including the campaign slogan. 
* The digital touch points. 
* How the campaign worked across country / time to build a sense of campaign momentum.
* Our throughts about how we would design a campaign plan graphic for this campaign (as a class). 

I will be pitching this campaign to you and explaining the rational between the different sections that have been included but you could also see this as a exercise in how you clearly explain the different components of a digital advertising campaign: The creative idea, the touchpoints and the campaign strategy (how the campaign works over channels and time).

## Why make a Campaign Plan? 

A campaign or advertising plan lays out exactly how and when a business will reach out to potential customers through various types of media and how they are connected. 

As we are planning advertising campaigns that will appraoch customers through a variety of channels (multiple digital, digital and physical, digital and print) it's important that we communicate how these threads will pull together to make an integrated campaign. 

## Campaign Plan Workshop

Now, let's break out the session and brainstorm your campaign plans. First, make a list all of your campaing touch points ie. which channels you will be using for your campaign. These should be justified against your target audience ie. you should have found a reason why these are good ways to make contact with your tartget audience. 

Now that you have this, ask yourself the following questions:

* Which media/experience will go out in which channel? 
* How will you release this content / expereinces over time? (Will one lead to another? Will they all reinforce each other at the same time? Will there be seasonal variations? Are there events or markers you are trying to hit in the year?) 
* How does your apprach to multiple channels make sense as a whole campaign? 
* Where will traffic / customer attention be channeled? What is the "call to action"?
* How can you visualise the above points? Now start to make these sketches. 


## The Degree Show

[A quick recap on last week.](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/tree/Digital_Advertising_2017/18/sessions/03#the-degree-show)

## Homework
    
**Part 1:** Make a mood board and initial branding of your creative. Choose your images carefully for your brand and target audience. 

**Part 2:** Digitise your concept one pager so that this can be a feature of your formative presentation next week. 

Add Image of one pager here. 

**Part 3:** Continue working on your campaign plan, digitise this if possible and add this to your formative presentation & hand in package. 

**Part 4:** Build formative presentation - this should reflect your branding outlined in your moodpboard/initial creative.
