# Week 4

### Today, Monday 24th October 2016

[Formative assessment](#formative-assessment):

1. [EyeBombing](#eyebombing) <sup>teams</sup> **10 minutes** / team
* [OneTweet](#onetweet) <sup>individual</sup> **5 minutes** / person
* [The Union Hack](#the-union-hack) <sup>teams</sup> **10 minutes** / team

### Your [homework](#homework) and [blog](#blog)


# Formative assessment

<!--- [ ] Why do we do this?-->

#### Today

You will present both your team projects ([EyeBombing](#eyebombing) and [Union Hack](#the-union-hack)) and your individual project ([OneTweet](#onetweet)). 

This means that you will present **three times** throughout the day.

We will give you **verbal feedback** after each round of presentations. That is, after all *EyeBombing* presentations, after all *OneTweet* presentations and after all *Union Hack* presentations. 

#### After today

We will type up the feedback and share it with you (via Google docs / Slack).

You will get feedback both on your team projects and your individual work.

You will reflect on this feedback (*self-assessment*) and write your thoughts in a blog post. See [more details below]().

### EyeBombing

* 8 teams
* **10 minutes** / team

This **team project** is about *looking* and *creating images*. Looking at everyday objects and our surroundings with different eyes and using **photography** to frame them, so that others can see what we want them to see.

All the project material is [here](../../projects/eye-bombing).

<!--When presenting your work, you may highlight: 

* **Originality** of your subject, the less *in-your-face* (obvious / common) a subject the better.
* **Manipulation**, the less you interfered with a subject the better. For instance, drawing a face on a dusty surface is not the point of this project. Arranging objects to resemble a face is ok, but we prefer *ready-made* subjects, which you simply found and framed, rather than manipulated.
* **Framing**, the point(s) of view you chose for your subject to highlight its *faceyness*. Framing an image has as much to do with what you include as what you exclude. 
* **Interpretation**, how your subject is cropped (or otherwise edited) to highlight its *faceyness*.-->

###  OneTweet

* 21 people
* **5 minutes** / person

This project is about about **typography** and creating *meaning with text*.

All the project material is [here](../../projects/one-tweet).

###  The Union Hack 

* 7-8 teams
* **10 minutes** / team

This **team project** is about about **symbols** and **brands**. By designing flags, you will devise symbols to represent identities and convert ideas into shapes. 

All the project material is [here](../../projects/union-hack).


# Homework

### Blog 

**Individually**, reflect on the feedback you received during the formative assessment, as well as your experience in this unit so far, and write about it.

Your post should address these questions (in no particular order):

* **ME**:
	* How and what did I learn?
	* What worked and what didn't?
	* Did I reach my goals, why or why not?  
	* How did I feel during the process?  

* My **TEAM**:
	* How did the team perform?
	* What worked and what didn't?
	* What can we do better next time?
	* Did the team reach the goal?
	* Was there conflict, how do we fix it?
    
    #### Symbols and brands

On the Google document I emailed you (you can also find it on Slack), there's a new table with topics around **symbols and brands** for you to learn and teach in our next session after formative.

We'll do this again in *teams*, but not the same people you worked with this week.

Your team **mini-lesson** should be **~10 minutes** and you may include:

* **3 key ideas**
* **Examples** and demonstrations
* Personal **experiences**
* **3 open questions to ask the class**

##### Topics: 

1. **Visual symbols** and their cultural meanings, eg: scales → justice, lion → strength/king, apple → health/temptation/tech-company, red → stop/error, floppy disk → save [etc](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheFloppyDiskMeansSaveAnd14OtherOldPeopleIconsThatDontMakeSenseAnymore.aspx).  
  
	Find plenty of *good* and *bad* examples.
* **Visual techniques** (aka *rhetorical devices*) for non-literal communication:   
	
	* simile 
 	* metaphor
	* metonym and synecdoche
	* irony / sarcasm
	* lies 

	Find plenty of *good* and *bad* examples.
* Designing with **colours**: [how to create your own palette](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/02/color-theory-for-designer-part-3-creating-your-own-color-palettes), even an [edible one](http://idsgn.org/posts/an-edible-color-palette)!
* Websites/apps as extensions of a **brand**. Pick 5 websites/apps and analyse their **colours**:
	
	* What brand *identity* and *values* do they aim to communicate?
	* How do they do that *through colours*? Be specific, make plenty of examples.
	* What *emotional responses* are the brands trying to trigger? Is it effective?   
  
	During your mini-lesson, first ask the class what their thoughts are and then present your findings.
* Websites/apps as extensions of a **brand**. Pick 5 websites/apps and analyse their **typography**:
	
	* What brand *identity* and *values* do they aim to communicate?
	* How do they do that *through typography*? Be specific, make plenty of examples.
	* What *emotional responses* are the brands trying to trigger? Is it effective?   
  
	During your mini-lesson, first ask the class what their thoughts are and then present your findings. 
* Websites/apps as extensions of a **brand**. Pick 5 websites/apps and analyse their **images&video**:
	
	* What brand *identity* and *values* do they aim to communicate?
	* How do they do that *through images&video*? Be specific, make plenty of examples.
	* What *emotional responses* are the brands trying to trigger? Is it effective?   
  
	During your mini-lesson, first ask the class what their thoughts are and then present your findings. 
* **Visual hierarchy** experiment, using websites/apps that your audience is familiar with:

 	* List the key information points that users are likely seeking.
	* Assign values (1-5) according to their importance to the average user.
	* Now, look at the actual design again.
	* Assign values (1-5) according to the actual visual importance as you see it in the live design.
	* Does the expected importance match up with the actual designed importance? If not, what could be changed?   
  
	During your mini-lesson, first ask the class what their thoughts are and then present your findings.
