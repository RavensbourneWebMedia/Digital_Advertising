### Your [homework](#homework) and [blog](#blog)


#### Looking back to last week

As there was a tube strike last week, I thought that I would quickly go over the deliverables for the course so that we all know what is expected for formative **next week** and summative at the end of term. 

All deliverables for this course can be found on the [Digital Advertising Campaign](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/tree/master/projects/union-hack) page. 


###  Multi Channel vs Omni Channel Advertising

This weeks lecture will focus around the differnt types of advertising campagin that include delivery to lots of separate channels. 

To contextualise these practices we will look at two Burberry campaigns and talk though:

1. Their target audiences. 
* Their campaign ideas. The core creative concept including the campaign slogan. 
* Their digital touch points. 
* How to map/communicate ideas for digital touch points. 
* how their campaign plans work across platforms against time. 


# The Degree Show

The Ravensbourne Degree Show 2017 will be June. There will be a Web Media private view as part of the degree show. 

In previous years the web media room has looked a little inconsistant whereas the degree show standard is very high. 

There is Ravensbourne budget to help put up your stands and set up the room so I would like to propose that we work together to design the room for this year.

# Homework
    
    #### Symbols and brands

On the Google document I emailed you (you can also find it on Slack), there's a new table with topics around **symbols and brands** for you to learn and teach in our next session after formative.

We'll do this again in *teams*, but not the same people you worked with this week.

Your team **mini-lesson** should be **~10 minutes** and you may include:

* **3 key ideas**
* **Examples** and demonstrations
* Personal **experiences**
* **3 open questions to ask the class**

##### Topics: 

1. **Visual symbols** and their cultural meanings, eg: scales → justice, lion → strength/king, apple → health/temptation/tech-company, red → stop/error, floppy disk → save [etc](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheFloppyDiskMeansSaveAnd14OtherOldPeopleIconsThatDontMakeSenseAnymore.aspx).  
  
	Find plenty of *good* and *bad* examples.
* **Visual techniques** (aka *rhetorical devices*) for non-literal communication:   
	
	* simile 
 	* metaphor
	* metonym and synecdoche
	* irony / sarcasm
	* lies 

	Find plenty of *good* and *bad* examples.
* Designing with **colours**: [how to create your own palette](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/02/color-theory-for-designer-part-3-creating-your-own-color-palettes), even an [edible one](http://idsgn.org/posts/an-edible-color-palette)!
* Websites/apps as extensions of a **brand**. Pick 5 websites/apps and analyse their **colours**:
	
	* What brand *identity* and *values* do they aim to communicate?
	* How do they do that *through colours*? Be specific, make plenty of examples.
	* What *emotional responses* are the brands trying to trigger? Is it effective?   
  
	During your mini-lesson, first ask the class what their thoughts are and then present your findings.
* Websites/apps as extensions of a **brand**. Pick 5 websites/apps and analyse their **typography**:
	
	* What brand *identity* and *values* do they aim to communicate?
	* How do they do that *through typography*? Be specific, make plenty of examples.
	* What *emotional responses* are the brands trying to trigger? Is it effective?   
  
	During your mini-lesson, first ask the class what their thoughts are and then present your findings. 
* Websites/apps as extensions of a **brand**. Pick 5 websites/apps and analyse their **images&video**:
	
	* What brand *identity* and *values* do they aim to communicate?
	* How do they do that *through images&video*? Be specific, make plenty of examples.
	* What *emotional responses* are the brands trying to trigger? Is it effective?   
  
	During your mini-lesson, first ask the class what their thoughts are and then present your findings. 
* **Visual hierarchy** experiment, using websites/apps that your audience is familiar with:

 	* List the key information points that users are likely seeking.
	* Assign values (1-5) according to their importance to the average user.
	* Now, look at the actual design again.
	* Assign values (1-5) according to the actual visual importance as you see it in the live design.
	* Does the expected importance match up with the actual designed importance? If not, what could be changed?   
  
	During your mini-lesson, first ask the class what their thoughts are and then present your findings.

### Blog 

**Individually**, reflect on the feedback you received during the formative assessment, as well as your experience in this unit so far, and write about it.

Your post should address these questions (in no particular order):

* **ME**:
	* How and what did I learn?
	* What worked and what didn't?
	* Did I reach my goals, why or why not?  
	* How did I feel during the process?  

* My **TEAM**:
	* How did the team perform?
	* What worked and what didn't?
	* What can we do better next time?
	* Did the team reach the goal?
	* Was there conflict, how do we fix it?
