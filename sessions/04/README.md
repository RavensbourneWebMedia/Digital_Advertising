## Concept One Pagers

As there were low numbers last week, I thought that I would quickly go over the deliverables for the course so that we all know what is expected for formative **next week**. We can individually catch up about summative deliverables if you would like to cover this section. 

All deliverables for this course can be found on the [Digital Advertising Brief](Add Brief to GIT Here).

Next Week for Formative, you will: 

ADD LIST OF TODO's for NEXT WEEK. 

## Campaign plans Past Student Work

This week the focus of the session is going to be on the strategy behind your campaign and it's touchpoinct and how a  campaign plan can help you communicate this in a simple and visual way.

## Multi Channel vs Omni Channel Advertising

![](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/Digital_Advertising_2017/18/sessions/04/Omni-channel_image_small.jpg)

This weeks lecture will focus around the differnt types of advertising campagin that include delivery to lots of separate channels. 

To contextualise this practice we will look at a second Burberry campaign and talk though:

* The target audiences. 
* The campaign idea. The core creative concept including the campaign slogan. 
* The digital touch points. 
* How the campaign worked across country / time to build a sense of campaign momentum.
* Our throughts about how we would design a campaign plan graphic for this campaign (as a class). 

I will be pitching this campaign to you and explaining the rational between the different sections that have been included but you could also see this as a exercise in how you clearly explain the different components of a digital advertising campaign: The creative idea, the touchpoints and the campaign strategy (how the campaign works over channels and time).

## Creating a Campaign Plan

A campaign or advertising plan lays out exactly how and when a business will reach out to potential customers through various types of media and how they are connected. 

As we are planning advertising campaigns that will appraoch customers through a variety of channels (multiple digital, digital and physical, digital and print) it's important that we communicate how these threads will pull together to make an integrated campaign. 

### Campaign Plan Examples

Now, let's break out the session and brainstorm your campaign plans. First, make a list all of your campaing touch points ie. which channels you will be using for your campaign. These should be justified against your target audience ie. you should have found a reason why these are good ways to make contact with your tartget audience. 

Now that you have this, ask yourself the following questions:

* Which media/experience will go out in which channel? 
* How will you release this content / expereinces over time? (Will one lead to another? Will they all reinforce each other at the same time? Will there be seasonal variations? Are there events or markers you are trying to hit in the year?) 
* How does your apprach to multiple channels make sense as a whole campaign? 
* Where will traffic / customer attention be channeled? What is the "call to action"?
* How can you visualise the above points? Now start to make these sketches.

### Blog 

Blog post: Reflect on the the work that you have created so far for the course touching on:

1. Your **20 concepts** and your top 3. Then how you chose your leading idea from your shortlisted 3. 
* The creation of your **elevator pitches:** Did you make more than one revision before reaching your final version? What are you pitches? 
* The creation of your **pitch document / one pager.** How you worked to digitise this after creating a paper sketch. 
* The creation of your **moodboard** and whether this has helped steer the look and feel of your campaign. 
* The **research** that you have gathered on your **target market.** 
* The creation of your **campaign plan.**
