# D&AD Winners

As there was low attendance last week, let's take a look at some examples of sucessful projects from last year to judge presentation style and overall project standard. These are just a chosen few, you could use others more relevant to your work for your profile (last weeks blog post). 

# Review Summative Hand Ins

Let's quickly review what you will need to hand in [next week.](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/tree/Digital_Advertising_2017/18/projects/Digital_Advertising#for-summative-presentation-monday-11th-december-in-lecture-hours)

Next week you will present your summative work. 

Last week you worked with the productivity planner to map out the remaining tasks you needed to finish for this project. This week we will review that work and make a final list of tasks before summative next week.
