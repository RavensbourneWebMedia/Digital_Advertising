## Presentation & Workshop: Prototyping in Invison

Before enhancement week we spoke about [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/). Has anyone used it before or been using it over enhancement week? 

We need to make visualisations quickly and be able to demonstrate our ideas to people on the device we intent them to use when experiencing the final product **without** reinventing the wheel. 

Let's do a mini [lecture](TO DO - Add Lecture) and workshop on prototyping in [Invision.](https://www.invisionapp.com/)

# Homework

### Telling Visual Campaign Stories 

This weeks homework will focus around the question: 

**How will you illustrate your digial advertising campaign ideas?**

Ealier we saw that some 2016 D&AD winners used video to explain their ideas. What will you use to show yours? 

* Making a digital product as part of your pitch? Could you make an **invision prototype?** Or could you use **Keynote?** Will this sit on the relevant device? An iOS app on an iPhone?

* Making an omnichannel campagin? Could you produce a **video** piece?

* Have you pitched an installation or art work? Could you make a **3D diagram** of the space? 

One thing the example projects have in common is a clear visual identity. 

**Does your campaign have an identity?**

* What font/fonts will you use? 

* What colours will you use to communicate to your audience? 

* What type of imagery will you need to shoot or produce? 

* Will there be sound? 

* How will this identity play out across different channels. 

For each of your campaign touch points, design a visual, prototype, diagram or video story board to explain your idea. We will review these next week in tutorials and make a plan for their further development. 

### Blog 

Navigate to the [D&AD New Blood 2016 Winners](https://www.dandad.org/en/d-ad-new-blood-awards-pencil-winners/) and find **two** projects that have relevance to your project. They could:

* Be written by the same company that issued your brief. 

* Be from a similar type of company to the one that set your brief (eg, a non profit or charity). 

* Have made a similar type of response to their brief as you are making to yours (eg, a technical piece of design like a website or app). 

* Be visually inspiring or use media in an interesting new way that you intend to apply your project. 

Now that you have your two projects, analyse and comment on the way in which the ideas have been presented. 

* What was the core message or elevator pitch? 

* What media was used to explain the project?
