# Lecture Advertising Practices and Principles

This weeks lecture will focus on [Advertising Practices and Principles.] (https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/master/sessions/02/Week%202%20Advertising%20Principles%20%20Practices.pdf)!

Lets take a break. 

# Why 20 Concepts?

### How do we generate quality ideas?

If you want to have **good ideas** you must [have **many ideas**](https://medium.com/founder-stories/9bd554bedce0).

**Most** of them will not be *good*. Even bad ideas can be useful to spark good ones. See the [McDonald's theory](https://medium.com/@ienjoy/mcdonalds-theory-9216e1c9da7d).

> We’ve broken the ice with the worst possible idea for where to go for lunch, and now that the discussion has started, people suddenly get very creative about places to eat. I call it the *McDonald’s Theory*: people are inspired to come up with good ideas to ward off bad ones.

This is why I've asked you to come up with at least 20 throw away ideas, and whittle them down to a half-decent 5 :)

Here are some of my own throw away ideas for interactive events concepts.

### Your turn: Show and Tell: Top 3 brief concepts

Individually or with your team mate, come to the front of the class and explain your top 3 concepts / responses to your brief. 

Also show us your sketches/scribbled concepts for your 20 ideas. Tell us how your top 3 are the most remarkable of your 20. 

You will have 6 minutes per team / individual. 

Reflection: 

What was the most challenging thing about describing your ideas? 

What was the most challenging part of coming up with your concepts? 

#Creative Concepts: Some pointers from Industry.

Some words of wisdom from creative advertising professionals:

* Always refer back to the brief to avoid creative misjudgement and make sure you answer it. Have your concepts answered the **heart** of your brief that we discovered last session?
* Don't go with the obvious idea. Other people will go the same way.
* Insight or rich understanding of the target audience should be a core factor in your work. Will your idea appeal to them? through which channels?
* Know what has been done before by the brand and its competitors.
* Test your idea on people to see if they would actually do it / react to it. 
* Focus on distilling the idea and explaining it succinctly. Then elaborate.
* Brevity and clarity are key. What's the core concept in a sentence?

We are going to focus on the last 2 pieces of this advice and work on clear communication of our concepts. 

# Elevator pitch

### What are the next steps?

You would think it's time to elaborate on your ideas and turn them into visuals. Not quite!

First we are going to define:

1. **What** is your idea?
* **Who** is it for?
* **Why** is it needed or wanted? / What problem does it solve?

Your pitches don't have to be statements, the could start with questions or scenarios like, 

* Don't you hate it when...
* You are traveling to a new city...
* When walking down a road...

Be imaginative. 

### Your turn

Develop your answers to the 3 questions above into an *[elevator pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch)*: a short and sharp communication that shouldn't take more than 30 seconds to tell!

Write your elevator pitch(es) the GDocs that I have shared with the class under your name. 

Now that we have condensed your ideas so they are crystal clear, we are going to get visual. 

# Concept one-pager

A one page document summarising your idea visually, so that you can talk about it to *anyone*. 

It typically includes:

* a catchy title
* a strapline
* Your elevator pitch (answers to the questions above)
* a visualisation of the idea (not necessarily your complete creative but something to contextualise your idea)

Some examples by your fellow students from 2016:

### Your turn

1. Individually, sketch out a concept one-pager (15 minutes).
* Discuss it  with your team mates (15 minutes).
* For next week's session, put together the best bits of your sketches into a team's concept one-pager.
* Share both your sketches and the team one-pager on Slack in the `#ux-design` channel. 

# Homework

### Visual perception principles

1. **Publish** your mini-lesson and any other relevant material from today. We recommend GitHub (we :green_heart: :octocat:) but you can publish elsewhere as long as it's accessible by anyone.

2. Add the link to your mini-lesson (and any other relevant material) to the Google document I emailed you.

### Peer learning research

#### Typography

On the Google document I emailed you (you can also find it on Slack), there's a new table with topics around **typography** for you to learn and teach next week.

We'll do this again in *teams*, but not the same people you worked with this week.

Your team **mini-lesson** should be **~15 minutes** and you may include:

* **2-3 key ideas**
* **Examples** and demonstrations
* Personal **experiences**
* Other relevant things you've read, heard or seen


Prepare **1-2 open questions to ask the class**. After your mini-lesson, we will have a short group discussion around these questions.

Topics:

1. How do people **read**? 
* **Typography vocabulary**: anatomy of a letter  
* **Fonts**: serif, sans-serif etc, weights and styles (also check out the [type shape game](http://shape.method.ac/)) 
* The personality of fonts: **expressive typography**
* Horizontal and vertical **motion**: alignments, kerning, tracking and leading (also check out the [kerning game](http://type.method.ac/))
* **Proportion**: typographic scales
* [Web design 95% typography](https://ia.net/know-how/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period)
* How to **choose the right font** (among other things, check out [WhatFont](http://chengyinliu.com/whatfont.html))

For everyone: check out [Thinking with Type](http://www.thinkingwithtype.com/)! 

### Project 

Work on *OneTweet*.

### Blog 

Write about *OneTweet*.

Reflect on the concept and document your **creative process**.

You can post pictures of scribbled notes, or jot down notes digitally. It doesn't need to be fleshed out and well written. The main goal here is to record your flow of ideas, not to make it beautiful!

<!-- Pair up with another team and **give each other feedback** on your peer learning mini-lessons. 

Use the feedback questions above to give / get feedback on your [mini-lessons' content](#mini-lesson-content) and [delivery](#delivery).

Then write down a *summary* of the feedback you received and a *list of action points* in response to the question: 

> What can be **improved**? -->
