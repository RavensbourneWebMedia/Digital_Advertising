# Research Folder Presentations

Add image here... 

Last week you were asked to prepare an annotated bibliography including 5 research sources where:

* 1 must be chosen from the unit reading list.
* 2 must address current digital trends within the advertising industry.
* 2 must address insight into the briefs target audience, their motivations, habits, behaviours and drivers.

This week we will start by sharing your insights gained from 1 x article on **current digital trends** and 1 x article on your **target audience** with the class. 

# Research Folder Share

Part of this weeks homework will to be to add the 6th research resource to your research folder. This will then become the foundation of your Digital Advertising investigation. 

Your 6th research sources must be selected from a fellow students annotated bibliography. This means that we will need to share our current work with the class for pooling on Aula.

# Lecture Advertising Practices and Principles

![advertising practices and principles](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/Digital_Advertising_2017/18/sessions/02/Ipod.jpg)

This weeks lecture will focus on [Advertising Practices and Principles.](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/Digital_Advertising_2017/18/sessions/02/Week%202%20Advertising%20Principles%20%20Practices.pdf)

Lets take a break. 

# Workshop: Breaking Down A Brief

Let's get started by choosing one of the briefs and leaning how to break down the brief. The brief you choose doesn't have to be your final choice!

![alt text](assets/How_To_Break_Down_A_Brief.jpg)

Briefs are essential but they can be overwhelming, so lets deconstruct our brief so get to the **heart** of what we're being asked for. 

Before we start, read your brief one more time so it's fresh in your mind. 

## Task 1: 5 Mins

Reread your brief but think about the **essential** points are, what **specific words communicate** and key pieces of info that **stand out**. Highlight them.

You are now going to break down the brief into just 16 words. These 16 words should communicate what the brief is asking you to do. Imagine you are giving this to someone instead of the full brief. How can you get them to understand what the task is in the same way but in only 16 words? Pull in any of the specific info or words you highlighted to help you.

Note down your 16 words only. 

## Task 2: 2 Mins

From your 16 words, really think again about what the **crucial points** are.

How many words could you shave and still communicate what the brief is asking you to do?

Let's try do it in 8? Ok, let's do it. 

In 8 words, what is the brief asking you to do? Rearrange the ones you have, use 8 new words or mix it up.

## Task 3: 1 Mins

So now you've got it down to the bare bones right? Those 8 words are all gold and they are completely vital. But which ones could you do without?

Try and get it down to just 4 words. Remember, you are trying to communicate as much of the information from the full brief as possible. 

Think about which words carry the most meaning.

## Task 4: 1 Mins

What next? Let's slim it down to 2 words.

Now you have your whole brief squeezed down into 2 words. You have identified the **heart** of your brief. 

It wouldn't be a good idea to use only these words when building your concepts, but now the other words and context of the brief should feel like a luxury. 

As you work on ideas for your brief, refer back and ask, "Is my idea / campaign communicating the 2 word, **heart** of my brief?"

Now that you have broken down your brief, how do you feel about the brief that you have chosen? Now is the time to stick or twist. 

# Intro to Sketchnoting

What is Sketchnoting? 


# Why 12 Concepts?

### How do we generate quality ideas?

If you want to have **good ideas** you must [have **many ideas**](https://medium.com/founder-stories/9bd554bedce0).

**Most** of them will not be *good*. Even bad ideas can be useful to spark good ones. See the [McDonald's theory](https://medium.com/@ienjoy/mcdonalds-theory-9216e1c9da7d).

> We’ve broken the ice with the worst possible idea, and now that the discussion has started, people suddenly get very creative. I call it the *McDonald’s Theory*: people are inspired to come up with good ideas to ward off bad ones.

This is why I've asked you to come up with at least 12 ideas, we will wittle these down over the coming weeks into the most promising :)

Here are some of my own throw away ideas for interactive events concepts.

![Interactive events concepts 2](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/master/sessions/02/ideation_2.JPG "Logo Title Text 1")

### Your turn: Show and Tell: Top 3 brief concepts

Individually or with your team mate, come to the front of the class and explain your top 3 concepts / responses to your brief. 

Also show us your sketches/scribbled concepts for your 20 ideas. Tell us how your top 3 are the most remarkable of your 20. 

You will have 6 minutes per team / individual. 

**Reflection:** 

What was the most challenging thing about describing your ideas? 

What was the most challenging part of coming up with your concepts? 

**Creative Concepts: Some pointers from Industry.**

Some words of wisdom from creative advertising professionals:

* Always refer back to the brief to avoid creative misjudgement and make sure you answer it. Have your concepts answered the **heart** of your brief that we discovered last session?
* Don't go with the obvious idea. Other people will go the same way.
* Insight or rich understanding of the target audience should be a core factor in your work. Will your idea appeal to them? Through which channels?
* Know what has been done before by the brand and its competitors.
* Test your idea on people to see if they would actually do it / react to it. 
* Focus on distilling the idea and explaining it succinctly. Then elaborate.
* Brevity and clarity are key. What's the core concept in a sentence?

We are going to focus on the last 2 pieces of this advice and work on clear communication of our concepts. 

# Elevator pitch

![Interactive events concepts 1](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/Digital_Advertising_2017/18/sessions/02/tenor%202.gif)

### What are the next steps?

You would think it's time to elaborate on your ideas and turn them into visuals. Not quite!

First we are going to define:

1. **What** is your idea?
2. **Who** is it for?
3. **Why** is it needed or wanted? / What problem does it solve?

Your pitches don't have to be statements, they could start with questions or scenarios like, 

* Don't you hate it when...
* You are traveling to a new city...
* When walking down a road...

Be imaginative. 

### Your turn

Develop your answers to the 3 questions above into an *[elevator pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch)*: a short and sharp communication that shouldn't take more than 30 seconds to tell!

What are your pitches? Let's share these with each other.  

Now that we have condensed your ideas so they are crystal clear, we are going to get visual. 

# Pitch Document / one-pager

A one page document summarising your idea visually, so that you can talk about it to *anyone*. 

It typically includes:

* a catchy title
* a strapline
* Your elevator pitch (answers to the questions above)
* a visualisation of the idea (not necessarily your complete creative but something to contextualise your idea)

An example from a 2016 student:

![](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/master/sessions/02/George_webb.png)


### Your turn

1. Individually, or in your small groups, sketch out a one-page pitch document (15 minutes).
* Discuss it with your team mate or the person sitting next to you. How does your sketch illustrate your idea? (15 minutes).
* Photograph your sketches and share your sketches with me via email. 

# Homework

### This weeks homework will be in 3 parts: 

### Part 1: Research Folder

Add the additional research resource to your folder by reading through other students folders and choosing a source best suited to your work and/or project brief. Write an origial summary (note: do not copy the summary of the other student) of the research source detailing the sources contribution to current advertising practice or the value taken from the piece for the your project development. 

### Part 2: Idea Generation: 

Using your observations from the breaking down the brief exercise, think about your brief and generate 12 ideas that could solve the brief. 

### Part 3: Target Market Insight: 

Review the insights that you have found about your target audience from your research folder and collect the motivations, behaviours, drivers, habits and hangouts of your target audience. If you have no information on their digital habits, find some. Bring these ready to share for the next session.
