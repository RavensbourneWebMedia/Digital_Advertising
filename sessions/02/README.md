# Lecture Advertising Practices and Principles

This weeks lecture will focus on [Advertising Practices and Principles.] (https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/master/sessions/02/Week%202%20Advertising%20Principles%20%20Practices.pdf)!

Lets take a break. 

# Why 20 Concepts?

### How do we generate quality ideas?

If you want to have **good ideas** you must [have **many ideas**](https://medium.com/founder-stories/9bd554bedce0).

**Most** of them will not be *good*. Even bad ideas can be useful to spark good ones. See the [McDonald's theory](https://medium.com/@ienjoy/mcdonalds-theory-9216e1c9da7d).

> We’ve broken the ice with the worst possible idea for where to go for lunch, and now that the discussion has started, people suddenly get very creative about places to eat. I call it the *McDonald’s Theory*: people are inspired to come up with good ideas to ward off bad ones.

This is why I've asked you to come up with at least 20 throw away ideas, and whittle them down to a half-decent 5 :)

Here are some of my own throw away ideas for interactive events concepts.

# Peer learning

### What is peer learning?

Learning from *each other, together*. It's a form of **cooperative** learning. 

In peer learning, everybody plays both the **teacher** and the **learner**.

<!-- > Docendo discimus [By teaching, we learn] -->

<!-- teaching forces you to dig deep and truly learn -->

By teaching to your peers, you reinforce your own learning. [It works](http://visible-learning.org/hattie-ranking-influences-effect-sizes-learning-achievement/hattie-ranking-teaching-effects)!

Also, you get to practice and build confidence in your **communication skills**.

### This is not a formal presentation

You're not being tested. 

You're not here to please me. 

You're here to teach to your peers and learn from them. 

#### We're here to become *co-learners*.

At the end of your mini-lessons we'll give each other **feedback**. *Honest* feedback can hurt but it's through that (and practice) that we improve.

<!--
**Intellectual scaffolding** should be provided by the teacher. Simply placing students in groups and telling them to *work together* is not going to automatically yield results. The teacher must consciously *orchestrate* the learning exercise and choose the *appropriate vehicle* for it. For instance:

* picking subjects for teams, raising questions/issues that prompt students towards more sophisticated levels of thinking
*  structuring the tasks that learners are going to perform, both independently and in class
* watching for and correcting mistakes 
* providing positive feedback and encouragement

**Affinity Groups**: groups of 4–5 students are each assigned particular tasks to work on outside of formal contact time. At the next formal meeting with the teacher, the sub-group, or a group representative, presents the sub-group’s findings to the whole tutorial group.

**Positive interdependence** emphasises the importance and uniqueness of each group member’s efforts while important cognitive activities and interpersonal dynamics are quietly at work. As students communicate with one another, they inevitably assume leadership roles, acquire conflict-managing skills, discuss and clarify concepts, and unravel the complexities of human relationships within a given context; this process enhances their learning outcomes.

Beware of *freeloaders*.

### Let the peer learning begin

#### 4 teams

~3 people per team 

#### 15 minutes per team

* ~10 for mini-lesson 
* ~5 for questions and debate

#### Mini-lessons topics

1. Closure
* Symmetry
* Figure/ground relationship
* Connectedness 
* Proximity
* Continuation
* Similarity
* Past experience 

### Let's give each other *honest* **feedback**

#### Mini-lesson **content**   
	
1. How did you **plan** your mini-lesson?
* What were the **key points** you wanted to get across?
* How did you decide to communicate them?
* What **assumptions** have you made about what we already know?
* How **interactive** was your mini-lesson? How was the audience meant to *participate*? 
* What **questions** have you planned to ask your audience? How *open* were those questions? What type of questions (*Right-there*, *Between-the-lines* or *Opinion-needed* questions)?
	
#### **Delivery**
	
1. What role did **visuals** (eg: slides) play in your mini-lesson?
* What role did each **team member** play in delivering the mini-lesson? 
* How did you **practice** your mini-lesson?
* How did your mini-lesson start? How did you *hook* your audience?
* What was your **body language** like? Consider facial expressions, movements of the arms, eye contact with the audience, and posture.
* What was your **voice** like? Consider speed of delivery, pausing, volume and pitch
	
#### What can be **improved**?

### A few tips and tricks

#### **FACT** 

Generally, people remember **2-3 ideas** from a talk. Which ones you want them to remember? 

#### **PLANNING** 

Don't try to explain everything. Pick out 2-3 **key ideas** from your topic and explain them in the simplest way you can. 

#### **INTRO** 

Explain the *background* of your talk and give a quick *summary* of what you're going to talk about. People will pay more attention if they have a sense of what's coming next

#### **SLIDES** are not a necessity. 

Ask yourself: is a slideshow the most effective way to communicate this? **How else** could I get this point across?
	
For instance, asking your audience a few *open* questions, getting them to play a game, break them out into small groups to discuss a scenario..

#### **SLIDES AGAIN**	 

If you *must* use slides, then:
	
* One **point** per slide.
	
* Don't cram long texts in your slides. Keep them down to a few *keywords* and one image or two..

#### **DELIVERY** 

Don't read out slides. 

It's distracting both for you and for your audience.

#### **TOP TIP** 

Use **examples** and **stories** from your experience. They will make your points more **relatable**: more interesting to listen to and easier to learn.


# Team project

### EyeBombing tutorials

This **team project** is about *looking* and *creating images*. Looking at everyday objects and our surroundings with different eyes and using **photography** to frame them, so that others can see what we want them to see.

All the project material is [here](../../projects/eye-bombing).

### 4 teams

### 10 minutes per team


1. Let's see your **images** and **edits**.  
	* What have you made?
	* How can you improve them? Quality vs quantity, **visual perception** principles you could apply...
* What has your **creative process** been so far?
	
	<!-- -->
* What's your team **GitHub repository**? 

	You may want to [create an *organisation*](https://github.com/organizations/new) (a GitHub group) for that. 


<!--# Typography 

Quiz: what's wrong with these pictures? eg kerning, line-height, too many fonts, wrong messages..-->

# Project

### OneTweet

This project is about **typography** and creating *meaning with text*.

All the project material is [here](../../projects/one-tweet).

# Homework

### Visual perception principles

1. **Publish** your mini-lesson and any other relevant material from today. We recommend GitHub (we :green_heart: :octocat:) but you can publish elsewhere as long as it's accessible by anyone.

2. Add the link to your mini-lesson (and any other relevant material) to the Google document I emailed you.

### Peer learning research

#### Typography

On the Google document I emailed you (you can also find it on Slack), there's a new table with topics around **typography** for you to learn and teach next week.

We'll do this again in *teams*, but not the same people you worked with this week.

Your team **mini-lesson** should be **~15 minutes** and you may include:

* **2-3 key ideas**
* **Examples** and demonstrations
* Personal **experiences**
* Other relevant things you've read, heard or seen


Prepare **1-2 open questions to ask the class**. After your mini-lesson, we will have a short group discussion around these questions.

Topics:

1. How do people **read**? 
* **Typography vocabulary**: anatomy of a letter  
* **Fonts**: serif, sans-serif etc, weights and styles (also check out the [type shape game](http://shape.method.ac/)) 
* The personality of fonts: **expressive typography**
* Horizontal and vertical **motion**: alignments, kerning, tracking and leading (also check out the [kerning game](http://type.method.ac/))
* **Proportion**: typographic scales
* [Web design 95% typography](https://ia.net/know-how/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period)
* How to **choose the right font** (among other things, check out [WhatFont](http://chengyinliu.com/whatfont.html))

For everyone: check out [Thinking with Type](http://www.thinkingwithtype.com/)! 

### Project 

Work on *OneTweet*.

### Blog 

Write about *OneTweet*.

Reflect on the concept and document your **creative process**.

You can post pictures of scribbled notes, or jot down notes digitally. It doesn't need to be fleshed out and well written. The main goal here is to record your flow of ideas, not to make it beautiful!

<!-- Pair up with another team and **give each other feedback** on your peer learning mini-lessons. 

Use the feedback questions above to give / get feedback on your [mini-lessons' content](#mini-lesson-content) and [delivery](#delivery).

Then write down a *summary* of the feedback you received and a *list of action points* in response to the question: 

> What can be **improved**? -->
