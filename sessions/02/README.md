This weeks lecture will focus on [Advertising Practices and Principles.](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/Digital_Advertising_2017/18/sessions/02/Week%202%20Advertising%20Principles%20%20Practices.pdf)

Lets take a break. 

# Why 20 Concepts?

### How do we generate quality ideas?

If you want to have **good ideas** you must [have **many ideas**](https://medium.com/founder-stories/9bd554bedce0).

**Most** of them will not be *good*. Even bad ideas can be useful to spark good ones. See the [McDonald's theory](https://medium.com/@ienjoy/mcdonalds-theory-9216e1c9da7d).

> We’ve broken the ice with the worst possible idea, and now that the discussion has started, people suddenly get very creative. I call it the *McDonald’s Theory*: people are inspired to come up with good ideas to ward off bad ones.

This is why I've asked you to come up with at least 20 throw away ideas, and whittle them down to a half-decent 5 :)

Here are some of my own throw away ideas for interactive events concepts.

### Your turn: Show and Tell: Top 3 brief concepts

Individually or with your team mate, come to the front of the class and explain your top 3 concepts / responses to your brief. 

Also show us your sketches/scribbled concepts for your 20 ideas. Tell us how your top 3 are the most remarkable of your 20. 

You will have 6 minutes per team / individual. 

Reflection: 

What was the most challenging thing about describing your ideas? 

What was the most challenging part of coming up with your concepts? 

#Creative Concepts: Some pointers from Industry.

Some words of wisdom from creative advertising professionals:

* Always refer back to the brief to avoid creative misjudgement and make sure you answer it. Have your concepts answered the **heart** of your brief that we discovered last session?
* Don't go with the obvious idea. Other people will go the same way.
* Insight or rich understanding of the target audience should be a core factor in your work. Will your idea appeal to them? through which channels?
* Know what has been done before by the brand and its competitors.
* Test your idea on people to see if they would actually do it / react to it. 
* Focus on distilling the idea and explaining it succinctly. Then elaborate.
* Brevity and clarity are key. What's the core concept in a sentence?

We are going to focus on the last 2 pieces of this advice and work on clear communication of our concepts. 

# Elevator pitch

### What are the next steps?

You would think it's time to elaborate on your ideas and turn them into visuals. Not quite!

First we are going to define:

1. **What** is your idea?
* **Who** is it for?
* **Why** is it needed or wanted? / What problem does it solve?

Your pitches don't have to be statements, they could start with questions or scenarios like, 

* Don't you hate it when...
* You are traveling to a new city...
* When walking down a road...

Be imaginative. 

### Your turn

Develop your answers to the 3 questions above into an *[elevator pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch)*: a short and sharp communication that shouldn't take more than 30 seconds to tell!

Write your elevator pitch(es) the GDocs that I have shared with the class under your name. 

Now that we have condensed your ideas so they are crystal clear, we are going to get visual. 

# Pitch Document / one-pager

A one page document summarising your idea visually, so that you can talk about it to *anyone*. 

It typically includes:

* a catchy title
* a strapline
* Your elevator pitch (answers to the questions above)
* a visualisation of the idea (not necessarily your complete creative but something to contextualise your idea)

An example from a 2016 student:

### Your turn

1. Individually, or in your small groups, sketch out a one-page pitch document (15 minutes).
* Discuss it with your team mate or the person sitting next to you. How does your sketch illustrate your idea? (15 minutes).
* Share your sketches with me via email. 

# Homework

### Develop your Pitch Document / one-pager

1. Continue to **develop** your pitch document or start again with a different sketch if you chnage direction. 

2. Research your target audience and ensure your pitch document is tailored to them. 

3. Digitise your concept one pager, add detail and try to communicate your idea consisely.

4. Bring this ready for tutorials on your idea next week. 

5. You are free to bring more than one version if you wish but you will be capped at 3.

Read [How to Make a Moodboard] (https://blog.filestage.io/make-brilliant-mood-board/) and reflect on the article.  

What you think creatives can acheive by presenting moodboards to clients? 

Now create a moodboard to accompany your concept one pager. 

How does your selection of images / video help contextualise your concept? 

How does it speak your audience and the brand that you are working with?
