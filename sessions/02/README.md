# Research Folder Presentations

![Rave Library Image](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/Digital_Advertising_2018/19/sessions/02/Assets/Rave_Library.jpg)

Last week you were asked to prepare an annotated bibliography including 5 research sources where:

* 1 must be chosen from the unit reading list.
* 2 must address current digital trends within the advertising industry.
* 2 must address insight into the briefs target audience, their motivations, habits, behaviours and drivers.

This week we will start by sharing your insights gained from 1 x article on **current digital trends** and 1 x article on your **target audience** with the class. 

# Research Folder Share

Part of this weeks homework will to be to add the 6th research resource to your research folder. This will then become the foundation of your Digital Advertising investigation. 

Your 6th research sources must be selected from a fellow students annotated bibliography. This means that we will need to share our current work with the class for pooling on Aula. Please share now.

Can everyone check that you can access each others work? 

# Lecture Advertising Practices and Principles

This weeks lecture will focus on [Advertising Practices and Principles.](ADD PRESENTATION HERE)

# Class Discussion and Brainstorm

![Apple Think different](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/Digital_Advertising_2018/19/sessions/02/Assets/Picasso_think_Different.jpg)

We've talked about creative ideas vs the touchpoints of a campaign. 

What is a creative idea? Can anyone give me an example? 

What is a creative touch point? 

# Class Brainstorm 1: Touchpoints

Let's take a moment to pool all of our thoughts about what could make a creative touchpoint for an advertising campaign. 

I will take notes and will share our thoughts on Aula for reference after. 

# Class Brainstorm 1: Innovative Technology in Advertising 2018

Researching innovative technology was a core part of your research folder homework task. 

Lets take a moment to brainstorm innovative technologues for 2018 so we have a pool to share as a class. 

I will upload these to Aula after class. 

# Workshop: Breaking Down A Brief

Let's review your choice of brief. Has everyone settled on one of the 4 briefs now? 

![alt text](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/Digital_Advertising_2018/19/sessions/02/Assets/How_To_Break_Down_A_Brief.jpg)

Last weeks focus was research, so this week we will return to the industry tasks we have been asked to solve. Breifs are essential but they can be overwhelming, so lets deconstruct our brief so get to the **heart** of what we're being asked for. 

Before we start, re-read your brief one more time so it's fresh in your mind. 

## Task 1: 5 Mins

Reread your brief but think about the **essential** points are, what **specific words communicate** and key pieces of info that **stand out**. Highlight them.

You are now going to break down the brief into just 16 words. These 16 words should communicate what the brief is asking you to do. Imagine you are giving this to someone instead of the full brief. How can you get them to understand what the task is in the same way but in only 16 words? Pull in any of the specific info or words you highlighted to help you.

Note down your 16 words only. 

## Task 2: 2 Mins

From your 16 words, really think again about what the **crucial points** are.

How many words could you shave and still communicate what the brief is asking you to do?

Let's try do it in 8? Ok, let's do it. 

In 8 words, what is the brief asking you to do? Rearrange the ones you have, use 8 new words or mix it up.

## Task 3: 1 Mins

So now you've got it down to the bare bones right? Those 8 words are all gold and they are completely vital. But which ones could you do without?

Try and get it down to just 4 words. Remember, you are trying to communicate as much of the information from the full brief as possible. 

Think about which words carry the most meaning.

## Task 4: 1 Mins

What next? Let's slim it down to 2 words.

Now you have your whole brief squeezed down into 2 words. You have identified the **heart** of your brief. 

It wouldn't be a good idea to use only these words when building your concepts, but now the other words and context of the brief should feel like a luxury. 

As you work on ideas for your brief, refer back and ask, "Is my idea / campaign communicating the 2 word, **heart** of my brief?" 

# Intro to Sketchnoting

![alt text](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/Digital_Advertising_2018/19/sessions/02/Assets/Sketchnoting.jpg)

What is Sketchnoting? 

Sketchnoting was originally developed as a visual form of note taking, where class notes would be documented using sketches as well as words. This has adapted and expanded over time to become a visual form of sketching that can be used to express anything the noter wants. 

We will be using this as a way to add both visual and written commnication to our digital advertisign concepts for next week. 

Assets for your sketch noting: [Download an A3 Sketchnoting grid](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/Digital_Advertising_2018/19/sessions/02/Assets/Sketchnoting_Grid.pdf) and print off twice so that you have 12 sections for concepts and an A2 sheet when joined together. 

Take these sheets home and fill with Digital Advertising concepts. Bring back as a poster for next week to chat through with the class. 

# Why 12 Concepts?

### How do we generate quality ideas?

Remember this from UX design? What is Mc Donalds theory? 

If you want to have **good ideas** you must [have **many ideas**](https://medium.com/founder-stories/9bd554bedce0).

**Most** of them will not be *good*. Even bad ideas can be useful to spark good ones. See the [McDonald's theory](https://medium.com/@ienjoy/mcdonalds-theory-9216e1c9da7d).

> We’ve broken the ice with the worst possible idea, and now that the discussion has started, people suddenly get very creative. I call it the *McDonald’s Theory*: people are inspired to come up with good ideas to ward off bad ones.

This is why I've asked you to come up with at least 12 ideas, we will wittle these down over the coming weeks into the most promising :)

Here's one of my own throw away ideas for interactive events concepts.

This will be the first part of your homework assignment for this week. Brought back ready to present to the class as a poster for next time. 

# Homework

### This weeks homework will be in 3 parts: 

### Part 1: Research Folder

Add the additional research resource to your folder by reading through other students folders and choosing a source best suited to your work and/or project brief. Write an origial summary (note: do not copy the summary of the other student) of the research source detailing the sources contribution to current advertising practice or the value taken from the piece for the your project development. 

### Part 2: Idea Generation: 

Using your observations from the breaking down the brief exercise, think about your brief and generate 12 ideas that could solve the brief. 

### Part 3: Target Market Insight: 

![Rave Library Image](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/Digital_Advertising_2018/19/sessions/02/Assets/Target_Market.jpg)

Review the insights that you have found about your target audience from your research folder and collect the motivations, behaviours, drivers, habits and hangouts of your target audience. If you have no information on their digital habits, find some. Bring these ready to share for the next session.
