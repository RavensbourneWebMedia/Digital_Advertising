# Digital Advertising Campaign

![](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/master/Think_Small.jpg) 

### This is a **individual** or **team project for two** about creating a *digital advertising campaign*.

During the course you will choose an industry brief and produce a creative campaign that is:

1. **Targeted:** Your campaign will target a specific audience. Your project cannot be for everyone or a general audience. 

2. **Editorialised:** You will determine and develop the most appropriate ideas to the market/product/client. 

3. **Optimised:** You will use methods to find out (and measure) the most effective methods of communication with a targeted audience, users or customers.

4. **Integrated:** You will research and choose the best (online, offline, traditional or new) methods to reach the audience you are targeting. 

## Choosing a brief

For this project it is recommended that you respond to one of the 16 D&AD New Blood Briefs but you are also welcome to respond to a brief that you have from an industry contact or write one yourself. 

If writing your own or using a bespoke brief, please finalise first with your tutor.

## The Process

* Decide on a brief. Research the target market. 
* Breaking down your work into the following sections; Art-direction, concepting and copywriting, produce several solutions for brief. 
* Develop the best solutions that address the brief and the demographic so that you have the following documents for assessments.
