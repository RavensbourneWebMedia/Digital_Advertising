# Digital Advertising Campaign

This is a **individual** or **team project for two** about creating a *digital advertising campaign*.

Flags are powerful visual symbols, brands before *branding* was even a discipline. By designing flags, you will devise symbols to represent *identities* and convert ideas into shapes. 

First you will *mash up* existing flags, and then *make your own* flag. 

1. Form **teams** of 2-3 people.
*  Watch [this TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/roman_mars_why_city_flags_may_be_the_worst_designed_thing_you_ve_never_noticed) about the rules of good flag design (and some funny examples of bad flag design).

* **MASH UP A FLAG** 

	Pick an existing flag and mash it up following these criteria:
	
	* Change one or more of its colours
	* Add or remove one or more elements
	* Change one or more shapes
	* Any of the above in combination 
	
	Produce minimum **4 variations** of your flag mash-up.
