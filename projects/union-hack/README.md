# Digital Advertising Campaign

![](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Digital_Advertising/blob/master/Think_Small.jpg) 

###This is a **individual** or **team project for two** about creating a *digital advertising campaign*.

During the course you will choose an industry brief and produce a creative campaign that is...

**Targeted:** Your campaign will target a specific audience. Your project cannot be for everyone or a general audience. 

**Editorialised:** You will determine and develop the most appropriate ideas to the market/product/client. 

**Optimised:** You will use methods to find out (and measure) the most effective methods of communication with a targeted audience, users or customers.

**Integrated:** research and choose the best (online, offline, traditional or new) methods to reach the audience you are targeting. 

##Choosing a brief

For this project it is recommended that you respond to one of the 16 D&AD New Blood Briefs but you are also welcome to respond to a brief that you have from an industry contact or write one yourself. If you would like to respond to a bespoke industry brief or write your own please work with your tutor to finalise your brief before the third session of the course. If not discussed in this time frame, please select one of the D&AD briefs below.

##The Process

* Decide on a brief. Research the target market. 
* Breaking down your work into the following sections; Art-direction, concepting and copywriting, produce several solutions for brief. 
* Develop the best solutions that address the brief and the demographic so that you have the following outlines for assessments.

##**For Formative Presentation: Thursday 9th Feb 2017 in Lecture hours**
