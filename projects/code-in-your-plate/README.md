# Code in your plate

This project introduces you to **coding** as a process of *translation*: from ideas to words, from words to sketches, from sketches to technical descriptions in various languages. 

You will get familiar with 2 of the 3 languages of the Web: **HTML** and **CSS** (JavaScript next term).
